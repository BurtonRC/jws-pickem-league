Admittedly, it doesn’t take much to get me excited about a new NFL season.  Just the opportunity to spend hours aimlessly watching football every Sunday is enough to get me to buy in.  Every year brings changes and this one is no exception.  Aaron Rodgers is taking his first pro snaps for a team other than the Packers.  Lamar Jackson is finally playing for an offensive coordinator other than Greg Roman.  All three rookie quarterbacks who were picked in the first round are starting from Week 1.  We''ve got five months to figure out what''s what. To get us started, as has been custom for at least four or five years, the opening weekend Wednesday Report team ranking, from worst to first.                  <strong>32 - Arizona Cardinals -</strong> I can’t see how this team scratches out four wins, with or without Kyler Murray.  They’re the worst of a handful of God-awful teams.                 <br><br>                  <strong>31. - Houston Texans -</strong> First-year head coach, rookie starting quarterback.  Never a good combination.  It’s hard to have faith in the Texans.                  <br><br>                 <strong>30. Indianapolis Colts -</strong> Forget about whether Anthony Richardson is going to be good or not.  With or without Jonathon Taylor, there’s too little talent.  With Synder now banished from the league, Irsay is the worst owner in the NFL.                  <br><br>                 <strong>29. Los Angeles Rams -</strong> After burning through draft picks for more than five years in an, albeit, successful quest for a Super Bowl, the Rams have 30 free agents on their current roster.   When they start 1-5 and Stafford looks everyday the 35 year-old he is, how long before McVay shelves Kupp, tanks the season, and envisions USC quarterback, Caleb Williams, at the controls?                 <br><br>                 <strong>28. Washington Commanders -</strong> Belicheck, with six Lombardis in tow, is on the hot seat, while Ron Rivera is permitted to grind out another five win season to add to his inglorious coaching career.  He''s entering, if not already well into, Jeff Fisher category, a world where through some unspoken edict one is given the ability to be a NFL head coach year after year, regardless of their win/loss record.  I suppose the new owner will give him another season before he kicks him to the curb.                  <br><br>                 <strong>27. Tampa Bay Buccaneers -</strong> When Baker Mayfield wins you’re starting quarterback competition, the script’s already written.  Take your five wins, fire your lame-duck coach and start over.                  <br><br>                 <strong>26. Chicago Bears -</strong> Trading the first pick overall pick to Carolina was good business.  They got a boatload of picks and players to help refurbish a long, down-trodden team.  Fields might still know how to play.  He has a lot of believers.  Not sure I’m one of them.                  <br><br>                 <strong>25. Las Vegas Raiders -</strong> Josh McDaniels second head coaching job is looking a lot like his first.  Short.  Even though it may not be all his fault, he’s the easy fall-guy for a team going nowhere fast.                  <br><br>                 <strong>24. Carolina Panthers -</strong> Frank Reich is a quarterback killer.  His track record of burning through quarterbacks-for-hire in Indianapolis was shameful.  Look out Bryce Young, you’re next.  Their defence better keep them in some games because their offence isn’t going to win them any.                  <br><br>                 <strong>23. Denver Broncos -</strong> Payton supposedly has Russ on a tight leash.  So when Russ doesn’t cook, then what?  You bring in the perennial back-up Jarrett Stidham to help save the day?  Good luck with that.  The Broncos will be paying for the worst trade in professional sport for years to come.                  <br><br>                 <strong>22. Cleveland Browns -</strong> Talent abounds, but we’re talking about the Browns.  If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.  Football’s richest contract (Watson) has to play a hell of a lot better than he was closing out last season, his first action in more than a year and a half.  You don''t want Watson on your fantasy football team.  He''s not the kind of guy you want to be cheering for.                 <br><br>                 <strong>21. Minnesota Vikings -</strong> I can see them finishing anywhere between 6-11 and 11-6.  Take away their 10-1 record in one-score games last year and 6-11 sounds about right.  I think the offence can still move the ball.  The defence?  Brian Flores is a good defensive coach, but he’s not a magician.                   <br><br>                 <strong>20. Atlanta Falcons -</strong> The last thing the Falcons needed from this year’s draft was a running back.  But from all indications, Bijan Robinson is the real deal.  It doesn’t help them at quarterback, or with their pass rush or their secondary, or any of a number of places they could have replenished.  But they should have a stellar ground game.                  <br><br>                 <strong>19. Tennessee Titans -</strong> I think I’m giving Mike Vrabel and the Titans the benefit of the doubt, because I don’t see it.  An aging quarterback, a running back who’s best years are behind him, and a discontented high-priced free agent wide receiver looking to cash out one final time.  That’s their offence, aside from a couple other questionable bits and pieces.  They better hope the defence is staunch.                  <br><br>                 <strong>18. New Orleans Saints -</strong> The best in a crop of really bad teams in the NFC South.  Carr is a definite upgrade at quarterback for the Saints and makes him the best quarterback in the division.  If Michael Thomas can start half the games, let alone re-emerge as a legitimate #2 receiver, the Saints might be spunky. That’s as far as I’ll go.                  <br><br>                 <strong>17. New York Giants -</strong> They bet on Jones, not Barkley.  Although both are on the team, they gave the four-year contract to Jones.  High risk to back a quarterback with only one solid season on his CV.  They’ll stick with the no frills, button-down offensive approach that served them well last year.  They won’t reach those same heights, but could contend for a playoff spot.                  <br><br>                 <strong>16. Green Bay Packers -</strong> They say the Packers have never been so united.  They knew what the source of dissension was, but until the off-season, were never prepared to fully embrace it.  Jordan Love will do just fine.  Throw in a couple young receivers with another year under their belt and a top ten defence and you’ve got a pretty good team.  Rodgers and the Packers had innumerable chances to get to, and win a Super Bowl.  It was time to zig.                 <br><br>                 <strong>15. New England Patriots -</strong> As anyone who’s ever read a Wednesday Report can tell you, I am a rabid, unapologetic Patriots fan.  Has the 25-25 post-Brady record been difficult?  Yes.  Are there better things ahead in 2023?  Yes, I believe there are.  Despite the toughest schedule in football, they’ll be a tough out.  They have a good, if not great, defence.  Their offensive line is a mess, but if Bill O’Brien can get more out of Mac and company, they could be a 10 win team. It doesn’t help being in the toughest division in football.                  <br><br>                 <strong>14. Los Angeles Chargers -</strong> Why would I have any faith in the Chargers?  Because they brought Kellen Moore from Dallas to run the offence?  The offence was seldom the problem.  They never fired their head coach who blew a 27-point lead in the playoffs to Jacksonville, the latest in a litany of missteps that has plagued the team since he took the reins.                 <br><br>                 <strong>13. Pittsburgh Steelers -</strong> This is a proud franchise.  If I didn’t dislike them so much, I’d be a supporter.  Six Super Bowls.  Three head coaches in 50 years.  Not much to dislike.  Since the Cleveland Browns came back to the NFC North in 1999, they’ve never had a better season record than the rival Steelers.  That tells you everything you need to know about a successful versus an unsuccessful franchise. They ended last year strong and I expect that trend to continue. If the AFC wasn’t so stacked, they’d be a shoo-in for a playoff spot.                  <br><br>                 <strong>12. Detroit Lions -</strong> Are we maybe getting ahead of ourselves?  After all, we’re talking about the Detroit Lions, the most tormented least successful franchise in football history, and we’re suddenly anointing them NFC North champs and football’s newest sweethearts, co-starring in the season opening game?  It takes more than one playoff season to wash away decades of futility.                  <br><br>                 <strong>11. Seattle Seahawks -</strong> I’m big on the Seahawks.  They’re a playoff team that will contend with the Niners for the NFC West.  Geno Smith’s ascent was not an aberration.                  <br><br>                 <strong>10. Jacksonville Jaguars -</strong> If you haven’t bought your Trevor Lawrence MVP ticket, you missed your chance.  At this point, everyone and their sister is in on it.  They’re adding Calvin Ridley to an already potent offence.  They’ll beat up on their AFC South underlings, but how do they stack up when matched against the big boys?                  <br><br>                 <strong>9. New York Jets -</strong>  This isn''t Hard Knocks.  No more curated production pieces they want to project upon the public.  It’s time to see what they got.  And on paper, it’s a panoply of talent.  Top of line quarterback, running backs and a stud receiver.  And their defence is unquestionably top three. Impressive pieces, but I don’t know how it all fits together.  When anything short of getting to the second-round of the playoffs would be considered a failure, they better hope they find their stride early.                  <br><br>                 <strong>8. Miami Dolphins -</strong> The Dolphins entire football season, quite literally, rests on Tua Tagovailoa’s shoulders.  One more concussion and it could be sayonara.  The very stringent rules his repeated head injuries forced  the NFL to implement (concussion protocol guidelines) could cost him a series, a game, or more than one year game in the ultra-competitive AFC East.  There’s a cost to pay for having your quarterback’s head made of the finest porcelain china.                  <br><br>                 <strong>7. Baltimore Ravens -</strong> LaMarr doesn’t throw outside the numbers.  Everything he throws is in the middle of the field; otherwise known as Andrew’s Country.  So they sign OBJ, draft the stud receiver Zach Flowers, and bring in a new offensive coordinator to push the ball down the field?  Call me crazy, but I have serious reservations about this new direction.                  <br><br>                 <strong>6. Dallas Cowboys -</strong> Is Pollard an every-down back?  As much as I think he could run for 2000 yards, he’s never been asked to shoulder the lion’s share of carries.  They have a top three defence and Cooks was a good addition on offence.  With Mike McCarthy calling plays, what could possibly go wrong?                 <br><br>                 <strong>5. San Francisco 49ers -</strong> The Trey Lance miss was a bitter pill to swallow, but it was never going to work.   They return much of the team intact from last year. Purdy remains a bit of a question mark, but bringing back Bosa is the pressing concern.  They''ll be in the mix at the end. They''re too good to be otherwise.                 <br><br>                 <strong>4. Buffalo Bills -</strong> Has the Bills Super Bowl bubble burst? The skeptics are crowding in, pointing to the Allen/Diggs feud, the lack of a running game, and a defence on the decline. They are the third best team in the conference, and unless they find a way to play their best football in January instead of October, that’s not going to change.                  <br><br>                 <strong>3. Cincinnati Bengals -</strong>  The Bengals will move the ball.  With Burrow, Chase and Higgins, it''s a given.  The challenge will be replacing the pieces that got away on defence.  This is a team that is built to win.  It follows the lead of its best player, who has proven through both his collegiate and professional career that he can take his team where it needs to get.                 <br><br>                 <strong>2. Philadelphia Eagles -</strong> Mega-talent on both sides of the ball.  While I expect the defence to regress slightly, the offence will only get better.  AJ Brown and DeVonte Smith are the best pair of wideouts in the league, and Goebart is an elite blocking/catching tight end.  Behind the best offensive line in football, they’ve retooled the backfield and still have a quarterback just beginning to realize his potential.  They’ll be contenders for years to come.                  <br><br>                 <strong>1. Kansas City Chiefs -</strong> They don’t have the offensive weapons we’re accustomed to seeing, but they still have Patrick Mahones, Andy Reid and Travis Kelce.  The biggest question is if defensive lineman Chris Jones continues his holdout.  He’s stated he’s prepared to wait until Week 8, willing to incur penalties of more than a million dollars in per week.  The trouble is he’s that good.  Like Aaron Donald, opposing offences have to game plan around one player. The Chiefs badly need him if they want to be the first repeat Super Bowl winner since 2005.                  <br><br>                 That''s how things stand from where I sit.  Tell me I''m wrong. And use more animated language if you like.  It''s okay, I’m a big boy.                  <br><br>                 You know the rules.  You must pick at least one db.  You must pick the winner of the PS Game of the Week twice; once flat and once with the point spread factored in.  And don’t forget your Survivor pick.  I have received annual dues from 13 of the 34 participants. If you''re in Canada, send me an e-transfer.  If you''re elsewhere, I''ll assist in making the necessary arrangements.                  <br><br>                 Please copy and paste the games and select your winner beside the game. Also identyify whether the team you selected is a db.  For scorekeeping purposes, it makes things considerably easier for me. Identify your Survivor pick at the bottom of your picks. All picks must be submitted before kick-off. You can select the Thursday game on Thursday and the remainder of games on Sunday. All picks are final.                              <br><br>                 Regards,                 <br><br>         <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>         <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>       </p>       </div>              </div>   </div> </div>     </body> </html>');

Good time to revisit where I thought things would stack up. Let''s see what John got right and what John got wrong.            <br><br>           <strong>32. Arizona Cardinals</strong> - I can’t see how this team scratches out four wins, with or without Kyler Murray.  They’re the worst of a handful of God-awful teams.  Got this one right, although you hardly had to be a football savant to foresee their season. The Bidwells, who own the team (third generation), are, for the most part, loathed within the organization. That''s not a good building block.<br><br>           <strong>31. Houston Texans</strong> - First-year head coach, rookie starting quarterback.  Never a good combination.  It’s hard to have faith in the Texans. Wrong. Wrong. Completely wrong. CJ Stroud is the rookie of the year. He''s got 14 touchdowns, 1 interception. Lots of cap space next year. Buy a receiver. Adams, Diggs, Brown, Hill - they all started somewhere else. They''ll be a couple good ones available this off-season. A young team with a big upside.<br><br>           <strong>30. Indianapolis Colts</strong> - Forget about whether Anthony Richardson is going to be good or not.  With or without Jonathon Taylor, there’s too little talent.  With Synder now banished from the league, Irsay is the worst owner in the NFL. They have over-performed, especially without Anthony Richardson, who will be good. Irsay is a bad owner. Says a lot of stupid things, but there are a number of bad owners.<br><br>           <strong>29. Los Angeles Rams</strong> - After burning through draft picks for more than five years in an, albeit, successful quest for a Super Bowl, the Rams have 30 free agents on their current roster.   When they start 1-5 and Stafford looks everyday the 35 year-old he is, how long before McVay shelves Kupp, tanks the season, and envisions USC quarterback, Caleb Williams, at the controls? Wrong. They have an outside shot at the seventh seed in the NFC. Pachau has been a revelation. If Stafford can stay healthy and play all the games coming in, they''ve got a chance. I don''t think he will.<br><br>            <strong>28. Washington Commanders</strong> - Belicheck, with six Lombardis in tow, is on the hot seat, while Ron Rivera is permitted to grind out another five win season to add to his inglorious coaching career.  He''s entering, if not already well into, Jeff Fisher category, a world where through some unspoken edict one is given the ability to be a NFL head coach year after year, regardless of their win/loss record.  I suppose the new owner will give him another season before he kicks him to the curb. Anything short of the playoffs and Rivera is gone. They got rid of their malcontents on defence and got a second and third round in return that they should use on offensive linemen. Sam Howell has played beyond expectations, but he''s sacked four of five times a game.<br><br>             <strong>27. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong> - When Baker Mayfield wins you’re starting quarterback competition, the script’s already written.  Take your five wins, fire your lame-duck coach and start over. Baker has played better than I thought and they will probably beat the five win total I''d given them. but change is coming. The team is owned by the Glazers, another reason to hate the Bucs. And I say that despite my dislike of Man U.<br><br>           <strong>26. Chicago Bears</strong> - Trading the first pick overall pick to Carolina was good business.  They got a boatload of picks and players to help refurbish a long, down-trodden team.  Fields might still know how to play.  He has a lot of believers.  Not sure I’m one of them. Mostly right. Fields can''t play. If there''s one universal law in football, in order to be a winning team, you need a good quarterback. Like deodorant, they can mask places where the team stinks.<br><br>            <strong>25. Las Vegas Raiders</strong> - Josh McDaniels second head coaching job is looking a lot like his first.  Short.  Even though it may not be all his fault, he’s the easy fall-guy for a team going nowhere fast. Right. It was exactly like the first. It wasn''t all his fault because the GM and the OC were canned as well. I still think it''ll be years before the Raiders are relevant again.<br><br>           <strong>24. Carolina Panthers</strong> - Frank Reich is a quarterback killer.  His track record of burning through quarterbacks-for-hire in Indianapolis was shameful.  Look out Bryce Young, you’re next.  Their defence better keep them in some games because their offence isn’t going to win them any. Right. Reich is gone at the end of the year. Tepper, like all bad owners, can''t leave football decisions to the people he hired to make them. Whether it was Tepper or the GM, they whiffed on Bryce Young. Be sure to tune in tomorrow - Carolina at Chicago. Field against Young. It''ll be an atrocity exhibition.<br><br>           <strong>23. Denver Broncos</strong> - Payton supposedly has Russ on a tight leash.  So when Russ doesn’t cook, then what?  You bring in the perennial back-up Jarrett Stidham to help save the day?  Good luck with that.  The Broncos will be paying for the worst trade in professional sport for years to come. Right. Russ''s numbers really aren''t bad, but nowhere close to what they should be for the ungodly sums they pay him. They''re not nearly as bad as they were at the beginning of the year, but after losing by 50 points, up is the only place they could go.<br><br>            <strong>22. Cleveland Browns</strong> - Talent abounds, but we’re talking about the Browns.  If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.  Football’s richest contract (Watson) has to play a hell of a lot better than he was closing out last season, his first action in more than a year and a half.  You don''t want Watson on your fantasy football team.  He''s not the kind of guy you want to be cheering for. Right. They have amongst the best defences in the league, if not the best, and are being undermined by a terrible quarterback situation.<br><br>           <strong>21. Minnesota Vikings</strong> - I can see them finishing anywhere between 6-11 and 11-6.  Take away their 10-1 record in one-score games last year and 6-11 sounds about right.  I think the offence can still move the ball.  The defence?  Brian Flores is a good defensive coach, but he’s not a magician. Mostly right. Every game they play is a one-score game. They''re 5-4, but could easily be 3-6. Whether Dobbs can keep the offence moving is a big if, but Flores has been a magician with the defence. The no-nonsense approach he learned in New England doesn''t win him popularity contests, but he calls an aggressive defence that the team is responding to.<br><br>           <strong>20. Atlanta Falcons</strong> - The last thing the Falcons needed from this year’s draft was a running back.  But from all indications, Bijan Robinson is the real deal.  It doesn’t help them at quarterback, or with their pass rush or their secondary, or any of a number of places they could have replenished.  But they should have a stellar ground game. Mostly right. The one position they excel at is running back. But it''s difficult to win with Ridder or Heinicke at the helm. That being said, it could be enough to win the NFC South and first-round home playoff game.<br><br>            <strong>19. Tennessee Titans</strong> - I think I’m giving Mike Vrabel and the Titans the benefit of the doubt, because I don’t see it.  An aging quarterback, a running back who’s best years are behind him, and a discontented high-priced free agent wide receiver looking to cash out one final time.  That’s their offence, aside from a couple other questionable bits and pieces.  They better hope the defence is staunch. Again, I don''t think I was too far off. The aging quarterback has probably played his last down as a Titan. Henry is still a quality back, but his best before date has expired. Yeah, Hopkins has had a couple good games, but 5.2 40 runners are being quickly replaced by speed. They won''t make the playoffs and I think 19th spot isn''t that far off.<br><br>            <strong>18. New Orleans Saints</strong> - The best in a crop of really bad teams in the NFC South.  Carr is a definite upgrade at quarterback for the Saints and makes him the best quarterback in the division.  If Michael Thomas can start half the games, let alone re-emerge as a legitimate #2 receiver, the Saints might be spunky. That’s as far as I’ll go. I wish I could pick games as well as give yearly prognostications. Pretty close. They have a one-game lead and one of the weakest schedules heading home.<br><br>            <strong>17. New York Giants</strong> - They bet on Jones, not Barkley.  Although both are on the team, they gave the four-year contract to Jones.  High risk to back a quarterback with only one solid season on his CV.  They’ll stick with the no frills, button-down offensive approach that served them well last year.  They won’t reach those same heights, but could contend for a playoff spot. Wrong. They''re one of the worst teams in football. They bet on Jones and it cost them. They''re going to have a top five pick in the upcoming draft, flush with good quarterbacks. They''ll get one, but Jones is still on the books and $36m he''s owed next year.<br><br>            <strong>16. Green Bay Packers</strong> - They say the Packers have never been so united.  They knew what the source of dissension was, but until the off-season, were never prepared to fully embrace it.  Jordan Love will do just fine.  Throw in a couple young receivers with another year under their belt and a top ten defence and you’ve got a pretty good team.  Rodgers and the Packers had innumerable chances to get to, and win a Super Bowl.  It was time to zig. Wrong. Jordan Love hasn''t done fine. He''s done poorly. The young receivers haven''t panned out as well as hoped. The defence isn''t top ten. They are young, and will get better with reps, but they''re not there. They have an outside chance at the seventh seed in the NFC, but I wouldn''t count on it.<br><br>            <strong>15. New England Patriots</strong> - As anyone who’s ever read a Wednesday Report can tell you, I am a rabid, unapologetic Patriots fan.  Has the 25-25 post-Brady record been difficult?  Yes.  Are there better things ahead in 2023?  Yes, I believe there are.  Despite the toughest schedule in football, they’ll be a tough out.  They have a good, if not great, defence.  Their offensive line is a mess, but if Bill O’Brien can get more out of Mac and company, they could be a 10 win team. It doesn’t help being in the toughest division in football. Oh Christ, where to start. Mac Jones is an abomination. His passes look like helium balloons. The defence lost their two best players for the year and quit. I think Belichick has lost the locker room, which puts Kraft in a bind because this off-season he signed Belichick to an extension. He''s the highest paid coach in football so he didn''t come cheap. I could never have imagined the Pats would sink so low.<br><br>            <strong>14. Los Angeles Chargers</strong> - Why would I have any faith in the Chargers?  Because they brought Kellen Moore from Dallas to run the offence?  The offence was seldom the problem.  They never fired their head coach who blew a 27-point lead in the playoffs to Jacksonville, the latest in a litany of missteps that has plagued the team since he took the reins. Right. Brandon Staley should not be a head coach. Justin Herbert is over-rated and they won''t make the playoffs. They''re not the 14th best team.<br><br>            <strong>13. Pittsburgh Steelers</strong> - This is a proud franchise.  If I didn’t dislike them so much, I’d be a supporter.  Six Super Bowls.  Three head coaches in 50 years.  Not much to dislike.  Since the Cleveland Browns came back to the NFC North in 1999, they’ve never had a better season record than the rival Steelers.  That tells you everything you need to know about a successful versus an unsuccessful franchise. They ended last year strong and I expect that trend to continue. If the AFC wasn’t so stacked, they’d be a shoo-in for a playoff spot. Somewhat right. It''s a great franchise and they have a great coach, but sometimes that''s not enough. See New England. Until they receive more consistent play from Pickett, they''re a .500 team.<br><br>            <strong>12. Detroit Lions</strong> - Are we maybe getting ahead of ourselves?  After all, we’re talking about the Detroit Lions, the most tormented least successful franchise in football history, and we’re suddenly anointing them NFC North champs and football’s newest sweethearts, co-starring in the season opening game?  It takes more than one playoff season to wash away decades of futility. Somewhat wrong, I think they''re about 12th. I agree with everything I said about them last week. They have tremendous upside and have exceeded my early-season expectations.            <br><br>           I ran out of time. Expecting company. The Jets shouldn''t be there and the Ravens should be higher.           <br><br>           <strong>11. Seattle Seahawks</strong> - I’m big on the Seahawks.  They’re a playoff team that will contend with the Niners for the NFC West.  Geno Smith’s ascent was not an aberration.<br><br>            <strong>10. Jacksonville Jaguars</strong> - If you haven’t bought your Trevor Lawrence MVP ticket, you missed your chance.  At this point, everyone and their sister is in on it.  They’re adding Calvin Ridley to an already potent offence.  They’ll beat up on their AFC South underlings, but how do they stack up when matched against the big boys?<br><br>            <strong>9. New York Jets</strong> -  This isn''t Hard Knocks.  No more curated production pieces they want to project upon the public.  It’s time to see what they got.  And on paper, it’s a panoply of talent.  Top of line quarterback, running backs and a stud receiver.  And their defence is unquestionably top three. Impressive pieces, but I don’t know how it all fits together.  When anything short of getting to the second-round of the playoffs would be considered a failure, they better hope they find their stride early.<br><br>            <strong>8. Miami Dolphins</strong> - The Dolphins entire football season, quite literally, rests on Tua Tagovailoa’s shoulders.  One more concussion and it could be sayonara.  The very stringent rules his repeated head injuries forced  the NFL to implement (concussion protocol guidelines) could cost him a series, a game, or more than one year game in the ultra-competitive AFC East.  There’s a cost to pay for having your quarterback’s head made of the finest porcelain china.<br><br>            <strong>7. Baltimore Ravens</strong> - LaMarr doesn’t throw outside the numbers.  Everything he throws is in the middle of the field; otherwise known as Andrew’s Country.  So they sign OBJ, draft the stud receiver Zach Flowers, and bring in a new offensive coordinator to push the ball down the field?  Call me crazy, but I have serious reservations about this new direction.<br><br>            <strong>6. Dallas Cowboys</strong> - Is Pollard an every-down back?  As much as I think he could run for 2000 yards, he’s never been asked to shoulder the lion’s share of carries.  They have a top three defence and Cooks was a good addition on offence.  With Mike McCarthy calling plays, what could possibly go wrong?<br><br>           <strong>5. San Francisco 49ers</strong> - The Trey Lance miss was a bitter pill to swallow, but it was never going to work.   They return much of the team intact from last year. Purdy remains a bit of a question mark, but bringing back Bosa is the pressing concern.  They''ll be in the mix at the end. They''re too good to be otherwise.<br><br>           <strong>4. Buffalo Bills</strong> - Has the Bills Super Bowl bubble burst? The skeptics are crowding in, pointing to the Allen/Diggs feud, the lack of a running game, and a defence on the decline. They are the third best team in the conference, and unless they find a way to play their best football in January instead of October, that’s not going to change.<br><br>            <strong>3. Cincinnati Bengals</strong> -  The Bengals will move the ball.  With Burrow, Chase and Higgins, it''s a given.  The challenge will be replacing the pieces that got away on defence.  This is a team that is built to win.  It follows the lead of its best player, who has proven through both his collegiate and professional career that he can take his team where it needs to get.<br><br>           <strong>2. Philadelphia Eagles</strong> - Mega-talent on both sides of the ball.  While I expect the defence to regress slightly, the offence will only get better.  AJ Brown and DeVonte Smith are the best pair of wideouts in the league, and Goebart is an elite blocking/catching tight end.  Behind the best offensive line in football, they’ve retooled the backfield and still have a quarterback just beginning to realize his potential.  They’ll be contenders for years to come.<br><br>            <strong>1. Kansas City Chiefs</strong> - They don’t have the offensive weapons we’re accustomed to seeing, but they still have Patrick Mahones, Andy Reid and Travis Kelce.  The biggest question is if defensive lineman Chris Jones continues his holdout.  He’s stated he’s prepared to wait until Week 8, willing to incur penalties of more than a million dollars in per week.  The trouble is he’s that good.  Like Aaron Donald, opposing offences have to game plan around one player. The Chiefs badly need him if they want to be the first repeat Super Bowl winner since 2005.            <br><br>           Tricky Rick is the first to crack the century mark and has opened up a five point lead. Conor, Adam and John Harper were all one pick away from a free steak dinner. The free steak dinner has been on offer for a perfect score since the Pickem competition commenced back in..... a long time ago. A lot of people have come close, but no one has got it yet. Still five alive in the Survivor Series. Check your score. And a reminder, all picks are final.           <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

We have a good game to start the week and a good game to end the week. The great game on Sunday will be the Grey Cup with Winnipeg against Montreal. Winnipeg is a 7.5 point favourite and you can take that one to the bank. This coming from a guy 19 points behind the leader in the Pickem.            <br><br>           Tricky Rick is a machine, consistently churning out solid numbers week after week. He''s opened up a seven point lead over Brett, who has correctly guessed every PS Game of the Week. If he''s not a gambler, he should be. Compare that to Daryl, who''s got one single measly PS point this entire year. Nonetheless, those are the last two standing in the Survivor Series. It''ll be a cage match from here, with only one man standing at the end.           <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

Despite being a 7.5 point favourite and a 10 point lead at the half, the Bombers simply didn''t do enough to win. They had a costly interception in the end zone and their defensive front, which has been a mainstay through the past four years, didn''t provide consistent pressure to rattle Als quarterback, Cody Fajardo, who played outstanding and was deservedly the MVP. The Bombers have been in four straight Grey Cups, winning the first two and losing the last two.  In none of the four championships has Zach Collaros, the Bombers quarterback and two-time league Outstanding Player, played well. It was another sub-par performance on Sunday. Although Winnipeg ran the ball effectively, I just don''t think running the ball on every first down is the right approach. The Bombers are getting long in the tooth and how much longer they can hold the team together is a big unknown. Collaros, Jefferson, Jeffcoat, Bighill, to name but a few, are at or near the end of their careers. It''s been a good run, but to come away with only two of four championships, is disappointing. I guess I''m greedy because you know every member of the Bills mafia would give up their left arm to have just one Super Bowl from the four championship games they played in from 1991-94.            <br><br>           What people have been saying since the beginning of the season was on full display Monday night. Kansas City has no receivers. Yeah, they have a number of guys wearing red 80 something shirts running down the field, but no one who can catch the ball on a consistent basis. Kelce is now 34 and if his recent MNF showing was anything to go by, appears more interested in fame and flying down to Brazil during the week to see his squeeze than winning football games. Kansas City is middle of the league in scoring and have an NFL-low 53 points in the second half this season. They were outscored 14-0 in the final two quarters Monday night, the third straight game they have been shut out in the second half. Mahomes isn''t the problem. Anything but. Marcus Valdez-Scantling dropped what probably would have been the game-winner late Monday. For the record, that is his sixth drop of over 30 yards this year. And he still gets on the field? These might be the two best teams in football, but I have much more confidence saying that about the Eagles than I do about the Chiefs.            <br><br>           We knew it was going to come to an end, and for all of us who had to suffer through more NY Jets prime-time games than we care to remember, it couldn''t come soon enough. Zach Wilson is being pulled in favor of Tim Boyle, the qb3 who was signed, not because of his quarterbacking upside, as much as he is Aaron Rodgers buddy. He had more interceptions than touchdowns in college, but don''t let that deter you, he is now the quarterback for the Jets. This was always what was always going to happen, and to pretend otherwise, as Robert Salah and GM Joe Douglas have, is ignorance. If you''re a Jets fan, how do you stomach watching Joshau Dobbs join the Minnesota Vikings, without knowing a player or a play-call, and winning, while your organization sticks with Zach Wilson, when all the evidence to prove he wasn''t a capable quarterback had been on display for the past year and a half? Hell, you signed Aaron Rodgers because you knew you couldn''t play. Jets season-ticket holders should get their money back.  Not because they field a bad team every week, but because they were sold a false promise; a promise to be genuinely serious with Super Bowl aspirations despite the loss of the player who was supposed to take them there. Do you think Howie Roseman, the Eagles GM, is sticking with Zach Wilson when Rodgers went down in the first series of the first game? Do you think any GM worth his weight sits on his hands the entire year, when everything they need to contend is present minus a qb? And can we please stop with Rodgers coming back this year? Back to what? The Jets are 4-6 and are for all intents and purposes, done for the year. There''s talk he could start practicing as early as December 2. Who cares? First of all, he didn''t have a torn achilles. No one with a torn achilles returns after 10 or 11 weeks. So after he gets you to believe he''s superhuman by returning eight months earlier than expected because of a misdiagnosis, he then goads you further into believing he''ll come back and salvage their season when he has no intention of coming back to a season that can''t be salvaged. Rodgers always thinks he''s the smartest guy in the house.  Rodgers is playing his price of genius card and further marketing himself as the savior of the Jets to anyone who''ll believe it. And who gets another prime-time, uncontested spot when the NFL debuts Black Friday? The gangrene Jets!            <br><br>           "You guys act like we''ve never played good defence. That''s not the truth. There are a lot of other things that caused us to lose the game today. It certainly wasn''t our defence."            Brandon, your defence, the defence you call, the defence you came to Los Angeles to fix three years ago, just gave up 400 yards to the Packers. The Packers! They''ve been looking for a good offensive showing since Rodgers left town.  This a week after giving up 450 yards to the Lions, albeit a much better offensive team. They own or are close to worst in all the defensive stats you don''t want to be associated with - yards allowed, points allowed, passing defence. And it has been this way for three years he''s been the head coach. If he was just the defensive coordinator he would have been fired long ago. With the walls closing in, his defiant bluster at the post-game press conference indicated it''s finally dawned on him that he''ll be a head coach for seven more games. When you have the number of stars the Chargers do, including Justin Herbert, and your record is 4-6, you are the best dysfunctional team in the league.  With quarterback injuries in the AFC (Burrow, Watson. Rodgers) and level of mediocrity in the league, why are they not the sixth or the seventh seed in the AFC, at the very least? It makes you wonder if the dysfunction doesn''t reach higher. While you have some owners like David Tepper that can''t keep their fingers out of things, you also have the brain-dead scions like Chargers owner Dean Spanos, who doesn''t see a problem when the problem has been parading up and down his team''s sideline for the last three years? He''s just too damn thick, lazy or iept to do anything about it.           <br><br>           I think the Seahawks loss to the Rams could cost the Seahawks a playoff spot. Sounds crazy when they''re 6-4 and comfortably in the playoff picture as the current fifth-seed in the NFC. Have you seen their schedule? San Francisco, @ Dallas, @ San Francisco and Philadelphia. They''re a 7 point home-dog tomorrow night and the spreads will only get worse in this four-game stretch. Suddenly 6-4 is 6-8 and you''re on the outside looking in. And this with Geno Smith, who missed most of Sunday''s fourth-quarter status for Thanksgiving  uncertain. Maybe they get in at 8-9, but they''ll rue the one that got away. Like the Bills, who are 6-5 and have let three or four get away. Of their 6 games remaining, they have Philadelphia, Kansas City, @ Dallas, Miami. The Cowboys and the Ravens schedules are equally tough, but they''ve got some wiggle room. Something the Seahawks and the Bills don''t.            <br><br>           Yeah, the Broncos are 5-5 and some people at the Athletic are already projecting them to 9-8 and a final playoff spot. Get a grip. When they win a game without being gifted three or four turnovers, we can talk.            <br><br>           Tricky Rick continues to put space between him and the rest of us. It''s now nine points after another ho-hum dozen. The Survivor Series ends in a tie. Sounds like a cricket match, where they play for five days and call it a draw. In this case, it went 11 weeks, but both Brett and Daryl both backed Rowboat Ron and the Commanders to take the Giants. Serves them right. Rowboat Ron. 13 years as a head coach; three winning seasons.            <br><br>           Like you hardly need a reminder, but we have three American Thanksgiving games tomorrow and a Black Friday game, which is such an easy-money grab it''s amazing the NFL hasn''t exploited it earlier. The early games (Thursday and Friday) are all dbs, but you better take one because the only other db all weekend is a pissed-off Chiefs team visiting the Raiders. Check your scores.           <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

All 34 of us were in on the Vikes.  Have we lost our collective minds?  First of all, we''re talking about the Minnesota Vikings; a NFL team that more so than any other takes stubborn pride in losing games they should win.  The fact they were favourites at home and that a win gives them the inside track on a playoff berth should have been enough to scare off more than a few of us.  Even the fact the quarterback is shacking up with a team-mate because history has told him not to get too comfortable (six teams in seven years) couldn''t deter us.  This is a team that asks their fans to stretch their loyalty to uncomfortable lengths to accommodate their penchant for failing in spectacular manner.  Knowing these things, it shouldn''t come as any surprise that they lost to the Bears, who came into the game riding a 12-game losing streak within the division.  That in itself should have had the staunchest purple and gold knowing a loss was at hand.  It may have taken more than 59 minutes, but in the end the Vikings do what they do best; further cement their ignominious legacy.           <br><br>           My take from the game, aside from the fact Josh Dobbs is indeed a journeyman quarterback despite what the past couple weeks may have suggested, is that there is nothing Justin Fields can do to stop the Bears from drafting a quarterback.  Joe Buck and Troy Aikman were talking about the final six games as being an audition or an evaluation period for Justin Fields to stake his claim to remaining the Bears starter.  In my mind, that ship has sailed.  He had a two and a half year audition and the reviews weren''t great.  Although he displays flashes, he just as often fumbles like he did at crucial times in the fourth quarter, bringing his fumble total from the beginning of last year to 23, tops in the league.  Chicago owns Carolina''s first pick and barring completely unforeseen circumstances, that will be the first pick in the draft. There are only so many times you get to draft in the top three with a pair highly-touted quarterbacks waiting in the wings.  Brock Purdy (pick 262) happens once every couple decades.  There is no greater competitive advantage that a NFL team can have than a good starting quarterback on a rookie contact.  Fields is in his rookie contract, but he''s entering year four next year.  If Williams or Maye are as good as advertised, the Bears get a younger quarterback at a lower price and a full five year window to build to winning team, something the Bears haven''t had for a very long time.  There''s a place for Fields, just not in Chicago.            <br><br>           News Flash: Frank Reich fired in Carolina, like we couldn''t see that coming, even if the end of the year seemed more likely.  He was fired after 11 games, the shortest coaching tenure in 45 years.  Urban Meyer had a longer time with the Jaguars than Reich did with the Panthers. When you get less time than the circus-act that was Meyers, there''s some fuckery afoot and his name is Dave Tepper.  He bought the team in 2018, fired Rowboat Ron the next year, hired Matt Ruhle out of college with no NFL experience to a 7 year, 63 million deal, fired him two years later with more than 40 million left owing, brought in Reich and decided to sack him after going 1-10, which in most cases in a fireable offence.  But more than Reich doing a good or bad job, is Tepper doing a disastrous job as owner.  On his third interim coach, Carolina has had six coaches since Tepper bought the team in 2018.  This is not a sign of organizational health.  Because Tepper owns the team, he thinks he knows football.  It doesn''t work that way.  Being a hedge fund manager does not groom you to evaluate football talent.  It was Tepper who wanted Young, not Reich.  And when Reich couldn''t make him a good NFL quarterback, Tepper fired Reich.  I don''t know if there''s a coach out there who can make Bryce Young a good NFL quarterback.  He''s small.  He has limited arm strength, limited mobility. Those are the credentials of an armchair quarterback, not the skills needed to play the professional position well.  Granted, he''s got a bad offensive line and a set of offensive weapons that would make even Chiefs or the Patriots cringe, but the evidence Bryce has provided can''t have Panther fans glowing with optimism.  Where it goes from here, God only knows. Unless you''re looking to be sacked and then live extravagantly with the millions Tepper is willing to give you to not coach the team, how can the Panthers hope to recruit a coach to work with a quarterback who has limited upside?  As Bill Parcells would say, "If you''re going to make me chef, at least let me choose the ingredients".           <br><br>           I''d already given up on him, but Jordan Love looked good on Thanksgiving.  They''re 5-6 and play KC this week, so let''s say 5-7, but their closing schedule is one of the easiest in the league.  If they went 4-1 coming home, which would be doable, they could slip in at 9-8.  After a good look at Dobbs on Monday, who the Packers play in one of their final five, we should put that hype train on hold.   Another team I''d already tossed to the scrap heap was the Rams.  They lit up the Cardinals and are also 5-6.  You know why running backs have such low market value?  Kyren Williams.  No one has heard of him one week and he puts up 230 yards up the next.  Add Stafford and Cupp and Pacua and McVay cooking up schemes and suddenly you have an offence putting up 500 yards, albeit against an anemic defence.  They have Cleveland coming to town this weekend, but after that performance in Denver, how much faith should I place in a 7-4 team?  I am still not buying Denver.  Not only do I have a hate-on for the ownership, but I have difficulty believing a team can lose by 50 and still be a playoff team.  I recognize teams change, develop familiarity, get better as the year goes on, but that''s a bridge too far.  They''re in Houston on Sunday.  The Texans, who I had listed as 31st team in NFL Ranking at the beginning of the year, is a legitimately good team.  Stroud looks like a star and I fully expect them to be in the playoffs at year end.  The more I read those last couple sentences, the more I recognize you should take nothing I say about football as credible and chalk it up to the biased, highly opinionated blather it is.  Listen to me and you''ll be fighting to get into the top half of the league as well.  It bothers me more than a little that I feel I have more than a layman''s knowledge of the game, yet my picking of games sucks.  Fargie, one of Daryl''s dogs who sees pictures flashing from a screen and who wouldn''t know football from spelunking, could put up numbers comparable to mine.  This, in no way, is meant to undermine those beneath me in the Pickem Standings.  We all have tough years.            <br><br>           A couple bookkeeping reminders.  Please include your selections from the early games with your submission on Sunday.  I really prefer not to go back through an email thread of 80+ submissions to find out who you took Thursday/Friday if you can easily include those selections with your later submission.  Just looking for ways to make this easier for me.  Although most of us understand the PS Game of the Week has two selections, some people continue to only give me one.  I recognize a number of the individuals failing to select the game twice aren''t fighting for top spot, but a point is a point.  Brett had his PS streak snapped at 11 when the Eagles never kicked the extra point in overtime, while Daryl and Doug held firm at one PS out of 12.  Tricky Rick for the first time this year failed to record in double-digits and saw his lead slip to seven, the same number of people I still think are still in contention to win.  I can''t imagine someone coming from nine back and leapfrogging six others along the way.  Sorry Chris.  By all means, prove me wrong.  Check your scores.  I going to have to round-up some of the outstanding dues. It would all be fine and good if I was going to win, but that''s not happening. I don''t want the winner sending their friend Rocco over to collect.           <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

In the AFC, Kansas City, Miami, and Baltimore are certainties, while in the NFC, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas and Detroit have all but stamped their ticket.  Let''s start in Philadelphia.            <br><br>           The big story, aside from San Francisco steamrolling the Eagles, was Big Dom.  If you didn''t see the game you''re probably asking, "Who''s Big Dom?"  Dom DiSandro is head of security for the Eagles, and is most definitely big, conservatively tipping the scales at three and a half, although it could be considerably more.  Big Dom might be the Eagles head of security, but at the speed he exhibited as he ambled off the field, he''s not in the business of chasing too many people down.  He got into a scuffle with 49ers linebacker, Jeff Greenlaw that got them both tossed In another case of officiating stupidity.   I don''t know what Big Dom was doing that close to the sideline and he most definitely instigated the melee, but he must be some kind of legend or personality because even the announcers knew him as Big Dom.   Anyway, take out a side-to-sideline linebacker for a team rep?  In no way is that fair.  Is this going to be a new cheap tactic?  In big games. make sure all your non-coach personnel on the sideline chirping all day, stirring up shit in the hopes you can lure a quality player from the opposing team into a scuffle?   I''m not saying the Eagles had Big Dom on the sideline with that in mind, but it sets an ugly precedent, and serves as a further example that referees should be full-time paid employees of the league, not store managers or bankers or househusbands, who ref on a part-time basis in a league worth billions, and where the weekly gambling market is the equivalent to the GDP of some war-torn, crime-riddled, malnourished African nation.  Big Dom got a standing ovation from the Eagles faithful as we waddled off the field and further burnished his legendary status with the team.  It got me thinking, what are the jobs of someone called Big Dom if he isn''t head of security for a professional football team? Bouncer? Number two man in a pizza place? Wrestler? Porn star?   As far as the game goes, the Niners went up and down the field six straight times for touchdowns, established themselves as the best team in the league, and Brock Purdy avenged his demons, winning a big game in a  hostile environment, Big Dom and all.  The Niners have outscored the three teams on their schedule that could be considered Super Bowl potential teams 118-29, although Jacksonville would be considered dubious at best. When the Niners team is healthy, it''s a beast.  In my mind, they''re the team to beat, but injuries will play a huge part down the stretch.  We saw what they were without Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams.  Good seasons, even potentially great seasons, can be derailed by an inopportune injury.  Tank Dell and Trevor Lawrence''s injuries are the first, of what could be several, that alter the fortunes of teams looking to make the postseason.           <br><br>           Has Gardiner Minshew single-handedly saved, or more perhaps more aptly, demonstrated the importance of the back-up quarterback position?  Remember, we were already writing off the Colts when they started 0-2, lost their highly-touted rookie quarterback, Anthony Richardson, for the year, hadn''t brought their star running back, Jonathon Taylor, because of a contract dispute, and laughed at their ludicrous owner, Jim Irsay.   Well, Minshew is 7-3 since coming off the bench, and has the Colts right in the middle of the wonky AFC playoff race, where even a 2-3 finish could get them in.  At one time, having a competent back-up put your team in an envious position.  I''m aging myself. but Don Strock, who played his entire career in Miami in the mid 70''s through the mid 80''s, was always reliable and could have started for a number of teams.  Frank Reich was like that.  Seldom took the field backing up Jim Kelly, but orchestrated one of the great playoff comebacks of all-time in bringing the Bills back from a 35-3  deficit to the Houston Oilers.  Fitzpatrick was always a back-up and a fairly reliable one at that before leveraging that into a string of one or two year deals as starting quarterback in the back-half of his career.   Hostetler, Foles, Matt Cassel, even Cooper Rush.  I know I''m missing a few, but in a league where 40 percent of the quarterbacks stink or have starters sitting on the shelf because of injuries, having Mustache Minshew has proven to be a great insurance plan. He is one the quiet success stories of the year.            <br><br>           So a couple weeks back I introduced the dirty dozen; bad quarterbacks called into action because the starter and/or the back-up was out of the game.  Nephew Matt forwarded to everyone some of the white knuckle quarterbacking duels we have on hand this week, starting on Thursday:           <br><br>           <strong>Bailey Zappe</strong> (New England) at <strong>Mitch Trubinsky</strong> (Pittsburgh)<br>           <strong>CJ Beathard</strong> (Jacksonville) at <strong>Joe Flacco</strong> (Cleveland)<br>           <strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> (Tampa Bay) at <strong>Drew Ridder</strong> (Atlanta)<br>           <strong>Josh Dobbs</strong> (Minnesota) at <strong>Adrian O''Connell</strong> (Las Vegas)<br>           <strong>Bryce Young</strong> (Carolina) at <strong>Jameis Winston</strong> (New Orleans)<br>           <strong>Gardner Minshew</strong> (Indianapolis) at <strong>Jake Browning</strong> (Cincinnati)           <br><br>           Of all those games with the least amount of quarterbacking talent on display, I''d have to go Bailey Zappe at Mitch Trubinsky.  I''ve seen Mitch play enough to know there is nothing there. He doesn''t pass the eye test; he didn''t in Chicago and time hasn''t improved his play in Pittsburgh.  Zappe delivers the same level of incompetence as Mac Jones, without the pick-sixes.  Oh, he''ll get picked.  He just hasn''t had any go the other way for points so far.  Give him time.  I could easily see that happening tomorrow night.  Just how bad is the Patriots offence?  Teams that give up 10 points or less are 51-3 this year. The three losses are all New England''s and have all happened the last three weeks. The Chargers were favoured by 5.5 last week against the Pats. They scored 6 and still covered.  Top that.             <br><br>           I have to resign myself to the fact that Bill Belichick won''t be back with the Pats next year.  It''ll be hard to see him in different colours next year, because don''t fool yourself, he''s coming back.  The inside track is Washington, with Riverboat Ron up the river and the new owners probably wanting to make a splash.  There are up to six or seven spots that could come open.  Las Vegas and Carolina are already looking.  Atlanta?  If Arthur Smith can''t get the Falcons in the playoffs, I''d say he''s gone.  New Orleans?  Dennis Allen hasn''t done much, in fact, very little, but he''s been with the team so long, I''m not sure if they''d pull the plug.  But it''s an old team in need of a complete redo on defence and three quarterbacks, none of which are any good.  Chargers?  Brandon Staley will be fired, and it''s an enviable position, but Spanos is tighter than a duck''s butt, and will settle for the cheapest option.  Chicago? No slight to Uberflus, because you can only do so much when you consistently get sub-par play from your quarterback, but I don''t think he''s going to be around to work with Caleb Williams.  Tampa Bay?  Someone should relieve Todd Bowles of his responsibilities, if for no other reason than to take him out of his torment.  That is the most unhappy looking man I have ever seen.  There''s stolid and stoic. He''s more saturnine than anything.  NY Giants?  You''re Coach of the Year one year and fired the next.  Despite his sour nature, I can''t see the Giants dumping after two seasons.  NY Jets?  Did you know Salah has seven kids?  And all with one woman?  In the NFL, that has to be some sort of record.  Oh no, I forgot Phillip Rivers.  Eight kids, one mother.  But getting back to Salah, how does that work?  You''re sleeping at the office or at the facilities 18 hours a day, seven days a week for six months of the year.  Meanwhile, your wife is trying to mother seven kids.  I definitely think Robert got the best of that deal.  As to his job security?  The defence loves him enough to compensate for all the missteps he took with Zach Wilson and should earn him at least another year.            <br><br>           Tricky Rick not looking so tricky these days. Back-to-back nines has his lead down to five.           <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

Maybe this is the route they had to go to win a Super Bowl?  They''ve come close.   If you''re old like me, you remember the Jim Kelly teams that knocked on the door four straight years but never got in that exclusive club of NFL champions. But when a tortured fan base finally breaks through, it has to be weird.  It''s never going to be easy: it has to come from the other direction.            <br><br>           There are a ton of examples, but the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles fits perfectly.  Believe it or not, Carson Wentz was a really good player early in his career.  Week 14 he goes down with a torn ACL and it appears yet another talented Eagles team was preparing to flame out in the playoffs, as they''d down for years with Andy Ried.  Nick Foles (Nick Foles!) comes off the bench to lead them to their first Super Bowl in franchise history.  Nick Foles and Doug Pederson against Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.  And they won.  I''ve never fully recovered.  It was weird, strange and highly improbable.            <br><br>                     Enter the 20223 Buffalo Bills.  They start 6-6, losing games they never should have lost and are in a genuine peril of missing the playoffs.  We find out that their coach was using the 9/11 terrorists as an example of working together.  This actually happened and it wasn''t an Onion headline, which I thought it was when I first heard it.  They lose their best linebacker.  They lose their best defensive back.  They fire their offensive coordinator and look where they are.  They''re 8-6 after beating the defending Super Bowl Champions on their home turf and then thumping the Cowboys by three touchdowns, with Josh Allen completing just seven passes all game.  Mid-season, the Bills had one of the worst defences in the league.  On Sunday, Prescott and the vaunted Cowboy offence couldn''t even get started.  The Bills will beat up the Chargers this weekend and the Patriots the next, before playing against the Dolphins, in a game that could be for the AFC East. Miami''s final three games: Cowboys, @ Ravens, Bills.            <br><br>                     As for the Cowboys?  What can you say?  Dallas is 7-0 at home and below .500 on the road.  The Cowboys average 40 points a game at home and have a +171 scoring margin.  On the road, they average 21 points and have a minus-4 scoring margin.  This is especially bad news for a team that probably is going to have to play at Philadelphia or at San Francisco to get to the Super Bowl.  It has played in both of those stadiums this year and lost by a combined score of 70-33.  Mind you, I''d like their chances against Philly after what has become of them.            <br><br>                    With the exception of the Jets against the Commandos and the Bears and the Cardinals, every game this weekend has playoff implications.  It was my plan to talk about a number of them, but it''s Christmas.

Only two other teams have accomplished that: (1972 Dolphins - Super Bowl Champions) (2007 Patriots - Lost the Super Bowl)             LaMarr Jackson is the Most Valuable Player. I think we''d forgotten how good he is after missing large portions of the past two seasons.            San Francisco will be fine. The same can''t be said of Philadelphia. They are a very vulnerable and would do well to get out of the wild-card round.            I really want to see the Rams against the Lions in the wild-card round. I think Staffford can go back to Motor City and win. The LA @ SF game in the final week could be huge. (June!)           <br><br>                     Joe Flacco should get Comeback Player of the Year. Does he play another year? He could, but it''s not going to be in Cleveland. He plays the Jets on Thursday; a team he''d played for and was familiar with, yet didn''t consider re-signing when Aaron Rodgers went down. That in itself should be enough to get Joe Douglas fired, but the Jets are already pledged to bring Douglas and Salah back for another year. This is how you award the braintrust of a franchise that hasn''t made the playoffs for 13 seasons,            Tell me anyone who had the Bucs pegged to win the NFC South with Baker Mayfield at the controls? His play this year could earn him, at a minimum, a two-year, $60 million contract. These sums are ungodly. Imagine looking at your portfolio and seeing eight or nine digits.           <br><br>                      Carolina had their best offensive performance last week against the Packers. The Bus had theirs the previous week. Coincidence? The only reason the Packers won''t be in the playoffs is their defence.            <br><br>                     Tricky Rick continues his stellar play. He hasn''t faltered since claiming the lead in Week 9. Matt is in the only position to reel him in with two weeks left.            <br><br>                     Happy 2024.

Pittsburgh is a three point dog in Baltimore, but the Ravens have home-field sewn up. What is their incentive for playing hard? Do they rest their starters? Wouldn''t they want Pittsburgh in the playoffs rather than the Bills, who I think are a better team and more of a potential threat to the Ravens? I think if Pittsburgh gets in and the Bills don''t, it would be a travesty. Does anyone legitimately think that the Steelers are capable of winning a playoff game, let alone three to get to the Super Bowl?                <br><br>                             Mason Rudolphis a markedly better than Trubinsky. It''s not even close. Yet Tomlin started Trubinsky ahead of Rudolph repeatedly, each game a loss. If Tomlin had started Rudolph in the games Trubinsky started, we wouldn''t be having this conversation because the Steelers would have already clinched a spot in the playoffs. Even if Pickett is ready to go this weekend, I would start Rudolph. He gives them the best chance to win.                <br><br>                             Can anyone in the AFC, but the Browns, go into Baltimore and win? No. Don''t see it happening. Lamarr is 1-3 in the playoffs and was very un-Lamarr like in all their losses. But this is a different LaMarr. A different offence, a different defence. The two constants have been Harbaugh and Justin Tucker, who are rock solid. Barring injuries, I can''t envision this year''s Super featuring anyone but the Ravens and the 49ers. All indicators put them a cut above the rest.                <br><br>                             Despite how inconsistent Jacksonville is, I can''t see them losing in Tennessee and winning their division. Lawrence has a litany of injuries, some worse than others, but as long as he starts, which he is expected as of publication of this rag, the Jags should win and claim the AFC Soft, which makes the game between Indianapolis and Houston for the final playoff spot. Indy is a point and a half home dog.                <br><br>                             In the NFC, SF has home-field locked up, but the one team they don''t want to face in the playoffs is the Rams. The Rams will either be the 6th or 7th seed, but they gotten better as the year has gone on. They have a good quarterback, a running back, and two good receivers. They have been a thorn in SF''s side since McVay has been coaching them. They''re the one team I can see going to SF and winning.                <br><br>                            What do you do if you''re Philly? Dallas will be up 14 by the end of the first quarter against Washington, so they''re going to be locked into the five seed. Do you risk further injuries to your starters or do you play them because they''ve looked like shit for weeks and need the work. In my mind, this is the db of the Week.                <br><br>                             Detroit has no one to blame for the fiasco with the two-point conversion in Dallas last week, but themselves. Three people checked-in, only 70 reported as eligible, and yet 68 catches the pass. Dallas wasn''t covering 68 because he never reported as eligible. Does 68 tell the refs he was eligible or are we to believe that Campbell told the refs they were going to do something like this ahead of time and the refs should have been fully prepared with the numbers in their back pocket ahead of time? it doesn''t work like that. There''s a play clock. All of this is happening in real time, fast-like. You''re dealing with referees who screw-up five to ten plays per week. And you want to put all your faith in them? Why should we be surprised they got this one wrong, if they did? The only ones who knew what was said were the players checking in and the refs.  Maybe don''t go for the two points at the 7? Maybe don''t make the two-point conversion a trick-play? Even the Philly special, which was a genuine trick-play, never involved ineligible receivers reporting in and hoping the refs got it right.                <br><br>                             You know how you solve this? Make the refs NFL employees.                <br><br>                             Detroit would have never had a chance to win the game if McCarthy wasn''t such a bonehead. Dallas has the ball inside two minutes. Detroit has one time-out and Dak is throwing 40 yard outs? They gave Detroit an extra 40 seconds to drive down the field, which they needed. I have no faith in McCarthy. I''ve been quiet about him all year, but you had to know something like this was going to happen. He leads the league in "What the fuck moments?" You''re watching the game and its just like, "What the fuck are you doing?" How can someone, who''s been a head coach for however long he''s been one, still make those kinds of mistakes, the mistakes that cost you football games.. They don''t have a running game, Jerry Jones is your owner and Mike McCarthy is your coach. You''re not winning the Super Bowl.                <br><br>                             Do I really care who wins the NFC Soft? I like more teams making the playoffs because there are more playoff games. But Tampa Bay, Indianapolis, New Orleans? You dreaded having to watch them during the regular season. Now I have to be tormented by watching them in the playoffs?               <br><br>                             Bill Belichick should remain with the Patriots. He shouldn''t become the winningest coach in NFL history while coaching another team. Dallas (because McCarthy should be fired), Washington or the Chargers aren''t going to give him GM, as well as coaching responsibilities. If Belichick won''t relinquish his GM duties in New England, Kraft has no choice but to sever ties. I just hope it ends amicably. If he leaves, I hope it is of his own volition, and not because Kraft can squeeze a first or second round draft pick out of him? Yes, his general manager moves in the last decade have left much to be desired, but there are few, if any, coaches I''d rather have. on the sidelines on Sunday. You can''t win with the quarterback play they gotten, either from Jones or Zappe. Buffalo was up 17 and Allen hadn''t completed a pass. It was like that game after game.                <br><br>                             While New England should do everything they can do to lose to the Jets to ensure a higher draft pick position, Belichick hates the Jets and has a 14 game unbeaten streak against them.                <br><br>                             Tricky Rick is four up coming home. It''s not insurmountable, but the odds are decidedly in his favour. Week 18 is tricky. You''re never sure if the team wants to play or even has to play. Even though 90 percent of the games have playoff implications, it''s hard to gauge a team''s motivation when so many things are beyond their control.                <br><br>                             Final results will come out next Wednesday with a breakdown of who wins what. I hope it''s been fun. I enjoy doing this for reasons I''m often at a loss to say.                 <br><br>               Regards,               <br><br>               <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>               <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

There are 18 holes in a round of golf and there are 18 weeks in a regular NFL season. Other than that, there are no similarities. One  is a team sport, the other individual. One is governed by a clock, the other not. One is made up of athletic freaks dressed in decorative colours every Sunday.  Hey, that kind of applies to football players as well.  Anyway, for anyone who plays golf, take a double on the first and you just want to call it a day or start the round over.   The NFL equivalent of doubling the first is getting thrashed 40-0 in the first game of the season or losing your star quarterback just when the fun was about to start.  Unfortunately for New York football fans, there are no mulligans in the NFL.  (As a short-aside, tough time to be a NY sports fan: the Yankees suck, the Mets are worse, the Giants are worse than we thought and the Jets are heartbroken).                   <br><br>                 The NFL has to be bummed that six Jets primetime games are scheduled sans Rodgers. The proof was evident Monday: The Jets-Bills bonanza was the most-watched “Monday Night Football” game in ESPN’s history.  I wonder if Tom Brady''s phone has started ringing?  Or Matt Ryan''s?  Or Phillip River''s?  As much as Salah said Zach Wilson will be the starter for the rest of the season, you know he''s just waiting for a better option to come his way.  The Jets can''t waste a Super-Bowl calibre roster with a sub-par quarterback.  The NY Jets at Dallas in Week 2 was a pick''em.  The Cowboys are now favoured by 9.5.                   <br><br>                 I''m going to keep it short this week.  Week 1 is wrought with over-reactions.                 <br><br>                 The top three seeds from last year’s AFC all lost in Week 1, two of them in ignominious fashion.  Josh Allen turned the ball over four times against the aforementioned Jets, while Joe Burrow threw for less than 100 yards against the Browns.  While Burrow missed a large portion of the pre-season with a calf injury and the Bengals are notorious slow-starters, Cleveland has Cincinnati’s number. They’ve won four of five against Burrow and 11 of the last 13 against the Bengals.  I’m willing to give  Cincy a pass.  The more detrimental loss was Buffalo and it followed a familiar script. The Bills can''t run the ball effectively so Allen tries to take it all on himself, throwing to receivers that aren''t open and taking chances that don''t have to be taken.  It''s one thing if you''re playing Mahones and you need 27 to win. It''s another leading 13-3 against Zach Wilson, the disgraced second-stringer who was the Jets whipping boy last year.  When Allen is on, he can look virtually unstoppable, throwing with precision and running like a raging bull. You want your players to be amped, but there was no need for Allen to play the second half like it''s the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl.  It was completely uncalled for.  Safe, mistale-free football and Buffalo wins.  Allen cost the Bills the game on Monday.  I know it''s Week 1, but this isn''t an over-reaction - the cakewalk to winning the AFC East and a high seeding the AFC playoffs is no longer a given.                   <br><br>                 Brandon Staley was hired by the Chargers because he was known as a defensive guru.  They have finished in the bottom half of the league in defense for the three years he’s been there.  They blew a 27-point lead against Jacksonville in the playoffs and yet he somehow retained his job.  He started his fourth season giving up more than 550 yards against Tua and the Dolphins. Tyrek Hill had more than 220 in sixteen targets.  The Chargers never once bracketed him and they never double-teamed him.  I was watching the highlights the other day.  I couldn''t believe it.  It was child''s play. <strong>Coaching Manifesto Rule 8:</strong> Don’t let the opposing team’s best player beat you. Force the other team to let their lesser lights get the job done. Let Waddle or Moshaert or whoever their third receiver is be the hero.  An explosive play is considered a run of 10 yards or more or a pass play of 20 yards or more. The Chargers gave up 18 explosive plays to the Dolphins. Top defences, like the Cowboys and the Jets or the Patriots, might not give up 25 explosive plays in a year. Chunk yardage after chunk yardage after chunk yardage.  The Chargers can be a good team, but even they can''t overcome bad coaching.  Miami plays New England on Sunday night. I won''t guarantee a Patriots victory. but I will guarantee you Tyrek Hill won''t have 200 yards or 16 targets.                   <br><br>                 Did you know, because I never saw it happen this weekend, that any player on the receiving team will be allowed to signal for a “fair catch” from anywhere between the goal line and his 25-yard line, rather than having to field the ball and face the wrath of the 11 players on the other team converging on him like a phalanx of merciless marauders.  After a fair catch, the ball will be placed on the 25-yard line just as it would after a traditional “touchback” in the end zone.  What the what!  In the past several years, teams have designed kick-offs to be hit high and fielded inside the 10 where coverage teams can wrap the player up before the 25, rather than kick the ball through the end zone and concede the ball to the 25.  Last weekend I saw several instances where a kickoff was caught at the 5, no fair catch, and the returner is buried under players at the 12.  Some coaches obviously didn''t get the memo. <strong>Coaching Manifesto Rule 15:</strong> Know the rules, all the rules, and how to use them to your advantage.                  <br><br>                 The league is essentially creating an incentive not to return the ball on kickoffs — a type of play reported to have a higher risk of concussions, although this evidence is sketchy at best.  This is the latest in a series of changes in what seems to be a prelude to eliminating it altogether.  It’s a terrible idea. No one likes it; fans, players or coaches.  It further undermines the blue-collar toughness that once defined football, not to mention that kick-offs have produced many of the N.F.L.’s most exciting moments: the Music City Miracle in 2000; Desmond Howard’s 99-yard touchdown return in the Super Bowl, or Gayle Sayers seemingly every time he touched the ball.  Football is divided into three parts: offense, defense and special teams.  Special teams is the aspect of football that has changed the least since the game’s invention.  Offenses have evolved in the past half-century from lumbering ground games to high-flying passing attacks that favor an elite handful of skill players. Defenses have done their best to adapt with a constantly changing set of sophisticated strategies. But kickoffs have largely remained the same, an area where effort can matter more than God-given ability.  The game is changing right before our eyes, with a steady and continual accumulation of rule changes that would make Vince Lombardi want to rollover in his grave.  Football can''t be adjusted on a whim according to the logic of business consultants and risk-averse corporate lawyers. It is violent game with players and coaches and a fan base of millions who care about its continuity with its past. Evolution in the game can occur, but not through corporate, top-down, profit-driven governance.                   <br><br>                 A few glitches the first week.  I inadvertently sent the WR to someone not in the league and omitted one of the entrants.  I straightened that away.  My apologies.  Remember to pick the PS Game of the Week twice - flat-out and then with the spread.  I do prefer you give me the game and then the winner, but if you choose to derisively snub me, at least give me the city/state/region and not the mascot.  Baltimore not the Ravens.  Give the Commissioner a little love.  Tough week in Survivor pool.  Two forgot their picks.  I think eight are already gone.  Tell me if you can''t access the spreadsheet attachment.

The more I watch this game the less I seem to know. Miami hanging a seventy-burger on Sean Payton team? Miami had the ball eleven times and scored a touchdown ten times. The only reason they didn''t score an eleventh time was the mercy rule. 730 yard of offence? That''s averaging more than 10 yards a play for the 71 they ran on the day. Offences are always utilizing new schemes and personnel. Pre-snap motion has become a staple of modern offences and are often used to disguise play selection or figure out whether the opposing defence is playing man or zone. But no one has even used motion the way Miami has or has the speed merchants to exploit defences so easily. At the same time, giving up 70! That''s unheard of, especially for a coach of the pedigree of Sean Payton. Say what you like, Payton consistently, for more than a decade, kept the Saints a viable, playoff-calibre team. Hell, he helped them win a Super Bowl. He hasn''t forgotten how to coach, but he''s obviously never come across of an offence like the Dolphins. The surprising thing is that Denver''s defence was supposed to help keep the team competitive. Last year, they were eighth is the league in yards allowed.  This year, dead last. When Russ Wilson is the ninth of ten cratering problems on your team, you''re in trouble. To steal a line from one of the Bourne movies, "You''re in a deep pile of shit and you haven''t got the shoes for it". The fact the Broncos are owned by the Walton family, the money-grabbing, child-exploiting, rapacious predators they are, makes it almost enjoyable. But at the same time, do you think the Waltons really care if the Broncos are a winning team? I mean, are they genuinely invested in whether they contend or not? People in Denver and Bronco fans around the globe care, but do the Waltons, cut-throat bandits they are, see the purchase of the Broncos as anything but another consistent money-making revenue stream? They''re making boatloads of money from the franchise win, lose or draw. I suppose the same could be said for any of the 31 billionaires that own NFL franchises, Green Bay notwithstanding. It may be quixotic of me, but I think Eagles owner, Jeffrey Lurie, who was an Eagles season ticket-holder since a child, or Robert Kraft, who was a life-long Patriots fan and season-ticket-holder, prior to owning the team, have a a stronger, more fervent attachment for their team''s on-field performance. Who knows? Maybe it''s just me. As Rupert Murdoch says it doesn''t matter if it''s red or blue (win or lose). it''s all about the green.                  <br><br>                 We''ll find out who''s the worst of worst when the Bears tangle with the Broncos on Sunday. To give you any idea of how bad the Bears are, the Broncos, fresh off a beat-down where they give up the kind of points you associate with setting your thermostat, are giving three in Chicago. The Bears have lost 13 in a row and have been outscored by 190 in that period. This a is a level of dysfunction that is hard to achieve in the parity-driven NFL. But there is a scenario where their incompetence could be rewarded. If they continue to suck, where we''re talking 3-14 kind of year-end numbers (I don''t know where they find three wins), they put themselves in the driver''s seat for the Caleb Williams sweepstakes.  There are four 0-3 teams.  The Bears own the first round-pick of two of those four teams; themselves and the 0-3 Panthers. And if you''ve wasted any time watching the Panthers, you know they have a legitimate claim on being amongst the worst. This looks like a race to the bottom with three teams vying for the services of what many are calling a Peyton Manning type of certainty at quarterback.                  <br><br>                 Although we have a pretty clear idea of who are the creme de la creme, NFL teams have played only three of their seventeen game seasons. We''re not even at the quarter pole.   It''s often said teams need at least four games to figure out who they are. Meaning fully recognizing what things do they do well and devising a formula based on those attributes to help them win football games. For a lot of teams, it''s far too early to be making any wholesale judgements, but on the Wednesday Report, that''s what we do. So what do I make of a bunch of 1-2 teams, including Jacksonville, Cincinnati, and the Chargers, all playoff teams from last year? The Chargers are a lost cause. Justin Herbert will put up gaudy numbers, but the Chargers view defence is more of a concept than one of the principal pillars of the game.  Any team that badly-coached cannot be taken seriously. To say Jacksonville has been underwhelming would be an overstatement. From a personnel standpoint, they''re better now than they were last year. It''s just not translating into wins. Can I honestly see either of them challenging the Chiefs and the Dolphins and the Bills for AFC superiority? No. Of the three, I have for more faith in the Bengals, despite looking competent in one of three starts. The Bengals were 4-4 last year before they got hot and rode it deep into the playoffs.                   <br><br>                 Usher is doing the Super Bowl halftime? I''m hardly a pop-culture maven, but wasn''t he relevant 15 years ago? If it''s the biggest stage on earth, shouldn''t the halftime show have the biggest star? You don''t have to look far to find her. There she is decked out in red and gold in a luxury suite at Arrowhead. Yes, Taylor Swift. She''s the most recognizable name is the English language. More so than Trump, Biden or Brady. I should have something more to say about the Travis Kelce - Taylor Swift thing, but I really don''t care. For the NFL, it''s another marketing bonanza, the pr that keeps on giving. It generates headlines simply by existing. Kind of like a Kardashian. I wish them much happiness in their affair/relationship/coupling, but this is hardly the discovery of a new vaccine. It should be treated as such.                   <br><br>                 I just want to make sure we understand how points are awarded in the Point Spread (PS) game of the week. You are essentially betting the game twice; once straight up and once with the point spread. They are distinct and separate bets. You get a point for each. If, like last week, one of the teams in the PS Game of the Week is a db, you can bet them to cover the spread, but you under no obligation to pick them to win the game. When dbs are featured in the PSGOTW, people often like to hedge their bets by taking the favourite to win and the db to cover, with the hope they win. You''ve heard of the expression, "Don''t put your eggs all in one basket". A lot of times that''s exactly what this is. Did I think Washington would win? No. Did I think they could cover and possibly win the game for me as a db, while at the same time fulfilling my db obligation of the week? That was a risk I was willing to take. Anyway, I hope that explains it a little better. Probably not. For some, it''s probably muddier now than before you read this paragraph.                 <br><br>                 Nine more bowed out of the Survivor series. Three weeks in and two-thirds of the entrants are out. What a sad lot. Not one of us saw Indy winning and only two of us had a db for the week, with Darren and Ross, backing the Texans. Our former champion, Matthew, had a six. All the worse when he calls out his beloved Cards to win in the preamble to his picks, only to back the Cowboys when his chips are down.  There are a number of us who withheld selections for the one of the Monday night games until that because Burrow''s health status was questionable. That is not a violation. Submitting your pick before kick-off is an absolute.                 <br><br>                 Regards,                 <br><br>         <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>         <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>       </p>       </div>              </div>   </div> </div>     </body> </html>');

After last weekend, I have an even greater conviction that the more football I watch, the less I know, at least from a pick''em perspective.  Cincinnati, who I doubled down on last week despite their 1-2 start, got throttled 27-3 to Tennessee.  I didn''t even think Tennessee was capable of scoring 27 points.  As for the Bengals, without their talisman, Joe Burrow, they are a rudderless ship.  Although the team hasn''t said they would sit him and allow the lingering calf injury to heal, he''s not doing the team any favours standing in the pocket looking more vulnerable than an aging Ben Roethlisberger.  The deep throw and the threat of the deep pass has been the Bengals offensive calling card since Burrow and Chase arrived.  With no leg to drive off, the top''s been taken off the offence with defences no longer fearing the big play and crowding the line of scrimmage.   Although that''s the biggest problem, it''s far from the only one. The offensive line is broken beyond repair and the defence, that had always been the effective, yet underappreciated unit, has lost its mojo.  Can they be resurrected?  There''s no easy solution.  They have no confidence in their back-up and the status quo is unassailable. After last week''s performance, it''s hard to have confidence in the Bengals moving forward this year.                  <br><br>                 And then there''s the Giants. This betting line on the game against Seattle started with the Giants giving 2.5. By game time, they were taking 2.5. Smart money looked at this team and saw what a lot of laymen already knew; this is a bad team. They have been outscored in the first half of this year''s games by a whopping margin.  They''re tied with the Bengals with the lowest average per play in the league. No Barkley doesn''t help, but they have no one to stretch the field , nor an offensive line that would protect Daniel Jones long enough for him to throw down the field. He was rained down on, sacked 11 times and under constant pressure. Repeated penalties on Monday night rendered that game virtually unwatchable. It was a constant barrage of yellow. Trips to Miami and Buffalo will leave Giants 1-5, the season lost and tied to a quarterback who will never be able to take where they want to go.                  <br><br>                 Finding and retaining a winning quarterback is as elusive to general managers as it’s always been. There are very, very few locks when it comes to picking a quarterback. Carolina had the first pick in last year’s draft. They’d paid a king’s ransom to Chicago to secure the first selection. The Panthers had their choice of three high-touted college quarterbacks all expected to go in the first five picks. Four games into the season, there’s no question they got it wrong. Whereas CJ Stroud, who went to Houston with the second pick and Anthony Richardson to Indianapolis with the fourth pick, have thrived, showing signs of maturity beyond their years, Bryce Young looks lost. Even with a dearth of talent on the offensive side of the ball, he looks small (5’10”), unsure and scared.                  <br><br>                 When you miss with your quarterback, you have to be getting everything else right to win. There are few teams that bet big on quarterback, lose, and retain their position. San Francisco bet big on Trey Lance, whiffed, yet held their own by finding the unplucked gem, Brock Purdy in the 7th round. In the last several years there have been far more misses than hits at quarterback in the first round. Last year, Kenny Pickett of the Steelers, was the only quarterback picked in the first. Although the jury is still out, early returns this year have been anything but positive. Two years ago, five quarterbacks went in the first. Only Trevor Lawrence will succeed. Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields and  Mack Jones won’t. Although three are still starting there’s no guarantee of their future beyond this season. Let me just briefly focus on Mack Jones. After last week’s debacle, he’s now 0-12 when the Patriots are underdogs. How can a team have faith in their quarterback''s ability to rise to the occasion, when he repeatedly sabotages the team''s ambitions? Strip sack touchdown and a pick-six killed the game before half-time. If anything Mack has regressed from last year when all the blame was laid solely at two defensive coaches who assumed control of the offence. High expectations came with Bill  O’Brien, but the play calling and offensive approach has failed badly. Every week they fall behind and this is not a team designed to come from behind. When you have third and half a yard from the Dallas five in your first possession, make it a four-down territory. Instead Mack flings it over the head of the wide open tight end and they settle for a field goal.  The Pats don’t merit even the few sentences I have given them, but another lost season and the unavoidable quandary of finding another quarterback depresses me to no end.                  <br><br>                 I completely ran out of time. Slew of crises arrived Wednesday.                 <br><br>                 Regards,                 <br><br>         <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>         <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>       </p>       </div>              </div>   </div> </div>     </body> </html>');

It''s selfish of me and somewhat cloying, but to fall from the unparalleled heights of success they rode on for two decades to back-to-back blowout losses the likes of which New England hasn''t seen for more than 50 years, I think it merits comment.                <br><br>               As mentioned before, I am a rabid and unapologetic Patriots fan. For a long time a source of pride (as if I actually had a role in their success), the Pats juggernaut is no more and has been gone for some time, steadily regressing from disappointment to misery and lately, downright disgrace. In the past two games, they''ve been outscored 72-3. How bad has it been? During the offense''s last 31 possessions, which spans more than two games, the Patriots have actually been outscored, 22-3. That''s three points for the offense and three touchdowns for opposing defenses. And that''s just one of the statistical atrocities of the current Pats. For all the talk of how horrible the Bears and Broncos are, I haven''t paid the Pats their fair due. We could talk about the pathetic play of Mac Jones, the absence of offensive playmakers or the mental mistakes, but more than a fair share of the ills and dysfunction of the team are directly attributable to Bill Belichick.  And that''s hard for me to say being a direct discipline of the "In Bill We Trust" school of coaching. But Bill ''s not just the coach. He''s the General Manager. He''s the Director of Player Personnel. He''s the be-all, end-all of the New England Patriots. There is no one in the league that wields the control of one franchise like Belichick. And therein lies the problem. Bill''s old school. Bill''s word is the only word. Fall in line or seek work elsewhere. For years the my way or the highway way of thinking has cost the Patriots hordes of institutionalized talent; coaches, evaluators, and confidants. They all left because they weren''t going to get a better job title in New England and found promotions elsewhere. Which brings us to the other side of the story. Belichick may run the team, but Robert Kraft owns the team.               <br><br>               There''s the school of thought that Belichick has earned the right to go out on his own accord, that the architect of the greatest dynasty in NFL history can coach in New England as long as he chooses. For all the success Belichick has brought Kraft, the current situation is testing the resilience of that relationship. Under all of this is Belichick''s pursuit of Don Shula''s all-time wins record. Belichick is sitting at 330 career victories, 17 behind Shula''s 347 wins. I don''t see win 348 coming for a long time; a lot longer than Kraft has patience for. He''s publicly lamented the team''s lack of a postseason victory in the post-Brady era and has grown frustrated over the shortage of success. When Kraft hired Belichick in 2000, he was an forward thinker during a time when many teams were still struggling to navigate the new cap system. What was seen as thrifty thinking back then, would be called cheap now. For years he could negotiate better deals with free agents because of the lure of playing with Brady and the very real chance of winning a Super Bowl Championship. Those days are gone. He''s failed to evolve. The examples are too numerous to name; failing to invest in a big-time receiver in a league trending in that direction while at the same time spending mid-round draft picks on special team players, an area of the game that is progressively being phased out. While other teams are constantly searching for coaches with new offensive philosophies and schemes, Belichick will bring back coaches who''d left earlier, recycling old ideas with underlings who are familiar with his top-down coaching style. Do you think it''s any mystery why Matt Patricia, Joe Judge and Bill O''Brien landed back with the Pats while overstaying their welcome elsewhere.                <br><br>               The fact is the Patriots are 26-29 since 2020, the 20th-best record in the league. More than half the league (18 teams) has won a playoff game since the Patriots'' last postseason victory in Super Bowl LIII. Maybe the Patriots do find a way to buck these trends. Maybe they just weren''t ready to compete with Dallas. Maybe they needed a wake-up call against the Saints. Maybe they''ll beat the Raiders and catch a better team sleeping a week later to reshape their confidence. Then maybe they''ll rally together as underdogs and remind the world they were once written off at 1-4. Enough maybes. The Patriots dynasty wasn''t built on maybes. They were the better team on the field nearly every week for almost 18 years — outplaying and out-coaching their opponents almost every week. Now, they''re second to last in point differential (-76), turnover differential (-8) and in current possession of the fifth pick in the 2024 draft, an indication of how far they''ve fallen. Being relevant this winter is out of the question. Which begs the question, what will Robert Kraft do? For some it may be intriguing. For others, who wish nothing but pain and woe for the Pats, it''s nothing less than they deserve.

Whereas last week we had a 15 and more than half the scores were double digits, this week there were numerous 3s and 4s. Former pick''em champion, Matthew, needed a db by Minnesota in the final game of the week to eke out a 3. Just to put that into some context, he was one for twelve in the dozen games earlier in the week. 1 for 12! That''s like a Captain Kirk record in prime-time.  Who would have guessed Cousins would show up on a Monday night? When the lights are bright, Cousins is usually out of sight, and I say that not in a good way. But he was brilliant on Monday. He carved up the Niners for close to 400 yards and stayed clean all night. The vaunted Niner pass-rush never touched him, and when they did get close he showed some quick feet in tight quarters, a quality he very rarely demonstrates. When he got picked on the first drive of the night, who of you had him having the night he did? With all that said, McConnell did his best to give the game away. His play-calling was ultra-conservative. I think they ran the ball on every first down. It was Cousins time and again who got them out of second and long and third-down situations. They kicked a field-goal on fourth and goal from the 2. They kicked a field-goal on fourth and goal from the 3. They missed a field-goal on fourth and four from the Niners 42, when they elected to run the ball on third down rather than let Cousins throw for the first-down.           <br><br>           Nonetheless, it was a great win for the Vikings. They thoroughly outplayed the Niners, one the top three or four teams in the league. They''re now 3-4 and just a half-game out of a playoff spot in the NFC. After starting 0-4 and talking rebuild,  they''ve won three in a row and proven to themselves they can play the big boys. I say this all before they go to Green Bay next Sunday and drop a brick. Count on it. Being a long-time Viking fan who was eventually anguished out, I''m telling you that''s how it plays out even before it happens. The question now becomes, what do you do with Captain Kirk? He''s 35 and contract runs out at the end of the year. If he walks, the Vikings have a big dead-cap hit (money they will have to pay because it was deferred earlier) and no quarterback. They can defray the cost if they sign him to an extension, but with Kirk putting up performances like he did last night, why would he want to sign an extension? Wait until the end of the season and let the bidding war begin for the self-proclaimed anti-vaxxer. The Vikings also have to negotiate a new contract with Justin Jefferson, which will be north of the four-year $120 million the Fins paid Tyrek Hill. Meanwhile, Commissioner John is crunching numbers to finance a modest refresh of his Wolseley house. Woest the life of a pleb.            <br><br>                         Speaking of Justins, are we sure Justin Herbert is a good quarterback? When was the last time you saw him play a good second-half, let alone engineer a four-quarter game-winning drive? The Chargers score 17 in the first half against the Chiefs and he''s a complete no-show in the second half. This is more than a trend. It''s a habit.  He had a chance to win their opener against Miami in the final minutes. Nothing. He had a chance to beat Tennessee in the final minute of their second game and didn''t make it happen. He played so extraordinarily the next week against the Vikings it makes you forget he let the two previous games slip away. The public has anointed and appointed him a great quarterback status, without the wins to back it up. The Chargers are 2-4 and looking every bit the pretenders they show themselves to be every year. Less than halfway through the year, the Chiefs have already claimed the AFC West. Their nearest contender in the AFC is not the Dolphins, who were beaten up by the Eagles, or the Bills, who''s decimated defence got sliced and diced by the mighty Mac Jones and the Patriots. The Chiefs biggest threat at this point looks to be the Ravens. They thoroughly embarrassed the up-start Lions. They were leading 28-0 before the Lions got a first-down. Lamarr is looking every bit worth the massive contract he signed with the Ravens this summer when no other teams, including many quarterback-needy team backed away, choosing to stay with Desmond Ridder and alike. Compare Lamarr with the other $250 million quarterback from the AFC Central, DeShaun Watson. I truly don''t understand what''s going on. You never know if he''s going to play because even when he''s given medical clearance to play, he chooses not to. When he does play, he gives his best impression of Nathan Peterman. Like anything conducted by the Browns, it turned into a PR nightmare, which they should have known it would be when they signed the disgraced quarterback from Houston in the first place.            <br><br>                         We''re down to a handful in the Survivor Series with three more tapping out this weekend. Five left. We got Tricky Rick Halas, the lucky gambler, or so he claims. Noel Leon, the one and only actual palindrome you''ll ever know. The Dublin Cowboy, Daryl Krywonis, transplanted Dubliner, who pines every year about this time for the cold of his hometown Winnipeg. Brett Steidl, one of the two Steidl in the competition, although I don''t know if he and Gavin are brothers or father and son. And Kong Vong, who goes by Nico, which I''m sure has nothing to do with the Velvet Underground.            <br><br>                         A full slate of 16 games this week.           <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

Let''s start with Monday night. Talk about two teams going in different directions. The Lions have young stars all over the place; Gibbs, Hutchinson, LaPorte, St. Brown. Two years ago, the Lions were 3-13-1, but they committed to rebuilding the organization from the ground up, accumulating draft picks and assembling a new coaching staff. They''re currently 6-2, the number two seed in the NFC and looking at their first NFC North Division title in decades. In the last 18 games, they are 14-4. I''m an old-timer and I can tell you the Lions have never strung together a record like that for 18 games. They''re far from perfect, but it''s hard to think of a happier, more encouraged fan base. After decades of scratching out a miserable existence on the outskirts of NFL recognition and visibility, the Lions have come roaring back.            <br><br>           And then there are the clueless Raiders, 9-16 under McDaniels, who''s proven for the second-time that being a good offensive coordinator does not make you a good head coach. They bring in a quarterback past his prime. Wrong. They spend big money on a prime-time receiver who doesn''t want to be there while negating other glaring deficiencies throughout the team. Wrong. They refuse to trade the disgruntled receiver for a first-rounder or acquire young assets for Maxx Crosby, whose efforts are lost on a team that''s stuck in the desert sand. Wrong. They''re 4-4 and consider themselves still relevant in the AFC. Wrong. This is a terrible team heading in the wrong direction in every conceivable way. And while Raiders fans are loyal, blindly following a misguided scion as he picks up moves operations from Oakland to LA to Las Vegas. It''s hard to think of a fan-base more dissatisfied with their football team. How''s it feeling for you, Noel? (This was written before the carnage.)           <br><br>           Speaking of offensive coordinators charading as head coaches, I present Kevin Stefanski. Despite playing with a back-up quarterback genuinely challenged by the talents required to play the position, Stefanski has PJ Walker throwing the ball late in the fourth-quarter when running the ball wins Cleveland the game. Kevin, you''re not the offensive coordinator any more. You''re the head coach. This isn''t about generating offence. Your job is winning games by whatever means possible. Seattle hasn''t moved the ball in two hours and instead of winning the game with your best unit (defence), you put it in the hands of a person least-qualified. Daboll, the Giants coach, did exactly the same thing. It''s windy, it''s raining, it''s miserable. Playing with their third quarterback. they''re somehow beating their cross-town rival the Jets, 10-7 with less than two minutes to go. They have fourth and less than a yard inside the Jet''s 20. Instead of putting the game in the hands of their best player, Saquon Barkley, who''d been their offence the entire game, Daboll puts it on the foot of a veteran  kicker who''s been sitting on the bench beside the heater for the last three hours trying to stay warm.  He probably didn''t want to be there anymore than the 80,000 on hand, including our defending Pickem Champion, Fran, who flew in from Dublin with his family for the game. I''m sure the ticket looked a whole lot more attractive before Rodgers was side-lined and the Giants became a laughing-stock. It was horrendous in all ways; weather, quality of play, coaching. There were a lot of memorable stats from the game, like the Giants throwing for -9 yards all game, but the one I like the best; the two teams punted 15 times in the first half. Anything to add, Fran?           <br><br>           Which brings us to what I''ll call the dirty dozen; quarterbacks who either started or came off the bench for their respective teams this weekend and stunk.           <br><br>           <strong>Tommy DeVito</strong> - Not to be mistaken for Joe Pesci''s character name is Goodfellas, DeVito was thrown into action when the Giants backup, Tyrod Taylor was knocked out of the game. I''d never heard of him, and after this weekend, I doubt I will again.           Mitchell Trubisky - He was bad for the Bears. He''s equally wretched in Pittsburgh. If the game to Jacksonville wasn''t already lost, Pittsburgh fate was sealed when he came on in relief of...           <br><br>           <strong>Kenny Pickett</strong> - His stock is plummeting. First play of the game, wide receiver screaming down the seam 30 yards deep. Pickett overthrows. Then he underthrows. Then he fumbles. Then he gets picked. The Steeler defence gives him good starting position almost every drive and he fails to deliver points.           <br><br>           <strong>Jaren Hall</strong> - He came on in relief of Captain Kirk, who is sadly gone for the year with an achilles tear. He''ll retain his place on the bench because the Vikings acquired at the trading deadline, the services of ....           <br><br>           <strong>Josh Dobbs</strong> - The Cardinal''s starter since the beginning of the year, filling in for Kyler Murray, who is slated to make his season debut next week. The Cardinals were so happy with the job Dobbs did, they shipped him to Minnesota on the next flight out.           Brett Rypien - I remember Mark Rypien. He won a Super Bowl. I don''t see that in the cards for Stafford''s backup.           <br><br>           <strong>PJ Walker</strong> - Cleveland is a quarterback away from being a playoff team. Watson''s status is always unknown, which puts the ball in PJ''s hands. Never a good thing.           <br><br>            <strong>Dorian Thompson-Robinson</strong> - He''s PJ''s back-up, who snuck in for a couple plays. If he''s lower in the depth chart than PJ, that tells you everything you need to know.           <br><br>            <strong>Zach Wilson</strong> - Don''t let Sunday''s last minute comeback mislead you, Zach is average at best and will not get to the Jets to the playoffs. He can''t process information quickly. The game moves too fast for him.           <br><br>             <strong>Desmond Ridder</strong> - He was pulled at half-time and replaced by Taylor Heinicke, who in my mind, should be the starter all along. In addition to being a poor passer, he''s fumbled seven times this year. (Again, written yesterday. They''ve taken my advice. Heinicke starts Sunday.)           <br><br>           <strong>Tyson Bagent</strong> - I''m more impressed by his father''s arm-wrestling championships.           <br><br>            <strong>Mac Jones</strong> - He retreated to usual form after last week''s aberration. He can''t be salvaged. Perhaps it''s the PTSD of working with Matt Patricia and Joe Judge last year, but he''s regressed considerably since his rookie year.           <br><br>           <strong>Jordan Love</strong> -  Another first-rounder who''s not getting it done. Everything we heard coming out of the pre-season was, he''s ready. No, he''s not, not even close.             <br><br>           I wouldn''t take too much away from Cincinnati''s convincing win over the Niners. We knew when Burrow returned to health, the Bengals would come with him. It was the Niners second game without Deebo Samuel or Trent Williams, two of their centrepieces on offence. Like most quarterbacks, Brock Purdy is more effective up ten points rather than down ten points. When the opposing team can pin their ears back because they know it''s going to be a pass, Brock is not who you want behind center. Fortunately, the team seldom puts him in that position because they flashed this stat during the game, Kyle Shanahan is 4-28 when trailing by 3 points entering the fourth quarter. He''s never won when his team is down 8 entering the fourth quarter.  But it''s the defence that''s gone missing. They acquired Chase Young at the trading deadline to help strengthen their defensive line that''s gone quiet. The season is long with a lot of ebbs and flows. So while the Bengals were on the rise, they caught the Niners on a two-game tail-spin. Barring unforeseen injuries, I expect both these teams to play deep into the playoffs.            <br><br>           The lucky gambler, <strong>Rick Halas</strong> continues to shine. One of the five alive in the Survivor Series, his sixteen spot puts him three clear at the top of the Pickem.

Football is back, baby! For the next five and half months, it''s non-stop NFL and gridiron''s on-going quest for world domination. They make their first foray into Brazil this week, and games happening four days a week is becoming the rule, more than the exception. Let the speculation and conjecture abound as we kick off the new season with our annual NFL Pickem team rankings.                  <br><br>                 <strong>32. Carolina Panthers</strong> - Unless new head coach Dave Canales is a miracle worker, I''m not sure Bryce Young can be a functional quarterback, let alone merit the huge aspirations of being a first overall pick. This is a troubled franchise that has been cratering since its meddlesome owner Dave Tepper bought the team in 2018.<br>                 <strong>31. New England Patriots</strong> - If they''re not the worst team, they''re damn close. What has become of my beloved Patriots? Their offence is a year away from being a year away. The offensive line is so bad they''re sitting their rookie quarterback for his own protection. Their three best defensive assets are absent; Matthew Judon was traded, Christian Barnmore has blood clots and hasn''t played this year and the GOAT of coaches is appearing on Manningcasts and podcasts galore. Who knew Bill Belichick had a personality?<br>                 <strong>30. Washington Commanders</strong> - The best thing that can be said about the worst named team in professional sports is they have a new ownership group. As well as a new coach, a new offensive coordinator, and a rookie quarterback. They also unveiled new jerseys. Sadly, none of that will change what has become an old habit; losing football games.<br>                  <strong>29. Tennessee Titans</strong> - After firing Mike Vrabel and failing to re-sign Derrick Henry, I have a hard time thinking the Titans of 2024-25 will be better than the far from contending Titans of 2023-24, If I had more faith in Will Levins in getting the ball to Calvin Ridley and past-his-prime-but still-potentially-still-dangerous DeAndre Hopkins, I might think differently.<br>                  <strong>28. Las Vegas Raiders</strong> - You can''t sugarcoat this. The Las Vegas Raiders are a bad football team. Don''t let last year''s 8-9 record fool you. The happy-go-lucky Gardner Minshew story has worn thin. When a career back-up becomes your starter in his seventh year, you know you''re in a bad place.<br>                  <strong>27. NY Giants</strong> - The expectations for rookie wide receiver Makik Nabers is neighbouring on ridiculous. Don''t forget who''s throwing him the ball? Daniel Jones behind a porous offensive line with no Saquon Barkley spells trouble, regardless of who''s on the outside.<br>                 <strong>26. Arizona Cardinals</strong> - Would Marvin Harrison Jr. get this kind of hype if his name was Austin or Bob? When you borrow the name of your Hall of Fame father, you court comparisons. Marvin Sr, had Peyton Manning throwing him the ball. I don''t put Tyler Murray in the same bracket.<br>                  <strong>25. New Orleans Saints</strong> - The Saints are playing on borrowed time. It''s an old roster with no room under the salary cap. They''ve been paying too many blue-chip salaries for red-chip players.  You can do that for a couple years if you''re competing for a SuperBowl. The Saints are only seeking mediocrity.<br>                  <strong>24. Denver Broncos</strong> - I''m a little higher on the Broncos than most. Rookie or not, Bo Nix will run a Sean Payton offence more effectively than Russell Wilson. All the same, it won''t be pretty.<br>                  <strong>23. Minnesota Vikings</strong> - The defence will continue to be aggressive and opportunistic. It''s the Sam Darnold offence that scares me now that their quarterback succession plan to Captain Kirk is on the sidelines for the year.<br>                  <strong>22. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong> - What is the common thread amongst all the teams in back-third of this year''s ranking? A suspect quarterback. You simply can''t win in the modern NFL with an average quarterback. And I would list Baker Mayfield as an average quarterback, despite perhaps his best season being his last. I don''t see a playoff team or a winning record. I see some bottom-hooping in the worst division in football.<br>                  <strong>21. Pittsburgh Steelers</strong> - See quarterbacking comments above. The defence should be even stronger after landing play-making linebacker Patrick Queen from Baltimore, but it won''t make up for a highly suspect offence.<br>                  <strong>20. LA Chargers</strong> - Jim Harbaugh is in at coach and Justin Herbert is still a quality quarterback, but offensive weapons Austin Eckler, Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are all gone. Like the Clippers in basketball, the Chargers can''t find a home in Los Angeles, where they play a distant second-fiddle to the other LA team as evidenced by opposition team fans outnumbering the powder-blue faithful in SoFi stadium.<br>                                <br>                     Any team from here on in can make the playoffs. I don''t see any teams 20 and up making it to the postseason.                 <br><br>                             <strong>19. Seattle Seahawks</strong> - It will be a new Seahawks era with Pete Carroll gone and the highly-sought after former Baltimore defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald taking the reins.  The former run-heavy schemes favoured by Carroll teams are expected to be replaced with a bigger passing game, putting a greater emphasis on Geno Smith to be at his best.<br>                  <strong>18. Indianapolis Colts</strong> - After getting a taste of what Anthony Richardson can do in the first three games last year, the playbook will be opened up, giving the second-year quarterback the opportunity to showcase his unique skill-set. With expectations sky-high, the Colts are a team on the rise.<br>                 <strong>17. Jacksonville Jaguars</strong> -  Although Trevor Lawrence is capable of being a top ten quarterback, there''s inconsistency. He averaged almost a pick a game last year and surrendered far too many sacks.  That, coupled with the team''s end-of-season melt-down last year, makes me wary of placing them any higher.  They also have the undisputed ugliest uniforms in football.<br>                  <strong>16. Cleveland Browns</strong> - The defence is top-five. The offence is another question. With DeShaun Watson, you can''t be sure what you''re going to get. Nick Chubb, lost in a gruesome injury in Week 2 last year, is on injured reserve and won''t be back until at least Week 5. Whether he can return to the dominant running back he once was remains a big question.<br>                  <strong>15. LA Rams</strong> - How do you replace Aaron Donald? You don''t. The defence is bound to take a step back, whereas the offence should be able to carry the load with a healthy Cooper Cupp, second-year stars Puka Nacau and Kyren Williams, and a more than capable, Matthew Stafford. The NFC West could be a highly-competitive division.<br>                  <strong>14. Chicago Bears</strong> - I can''t believe I have the Bears ranked 14th. They''ve been also-rans for so long it looks like a misprint. But after getting a boatload of players and draft picks from Carolina for last year''s first overall draft pick, and selecting Caleb Williams with this year''s first overall, the team seems set to challenge for the first time in a long time.<br>                 <strong>13. Atlanta Falcons</strong> - I don''t know how good the Falcons are. They''ll win the NFC South by beating a trio of bad teams in Carolina, New Orleans and Tampa Bay. They''ve brought in a lot of new faces, including Captain Kirk, who should provide a serious upgrade at quarterback.<br>                 <strong>12 Miami Dolphins</strong> - In the Miami Dolphins, I see a team with a lot of flash and not enough grit. They have speed to burn on offence, and a coach that can draw-up play-action schemes defences seldom see, All the same, I always fear Tua is one big hit from a brain injury. They''re missing a couple key pieces on defence (Christian Wilkins and Bradley Chubb on PUP) and the toughness a Vic Fangio defence-coached team always has.<br>                 <strong>11. Green Bay Packers</strong> - They''re young, one of the youngest rosters in football. And after the smackdown they gave Dallas in Dallas last January, and the scare they gave San Francisco, anything but a deep run in the postseason would be a disappointment. Jordan Love was great in the last half of the season. Can he be great for an entire season?<br>                 <strong>10. Dallas Cowboys</strong> - The Cowboys make as many off-the-field headlines as they do on-the-field. If it''s not Ceedee Lamb''s new contract, it''s Dak''s lack of a new contract. And Jerry Jones will tell you everything you don''t need to know about the Cowboys whether he''s asked or not. Long-time defensive coordinator and former head coach of the Vikings, Mike Zimmer comes out of retirement to take over the defence. I like the move.<br>                   <strong>9. NY Jets</strong> - They could be frauds, but until we see what Aaron Rodgers can do at 41, all bets are off. Garrett Wilson is a stud outside and Breece Hall was the top pick on many fantasy football boards. If all the offensive line additions can mesh into a workable unit, perhaps they can work some 1969 magic. I seriously doubt it.<br>                 <strong>8. Buffalo Bills</strong> - This is the Josh Allen show and he, and he alone, will dictate the fortunes of the Bills. Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis are gone on offence, and their best defensive player, Matt Milano, is expected to miss the majority of 2024 with a torn bicep. If the Bills Super Bowl window hasn''t closed completely, it''s perilously close.<br>                  <strong>7. Cincinnati Bengals</strong> - Like the Bills, the Bengals aspirations are tied to their quarterback. Joe Burrow missed the majority of last year and the health of his throwing arm remains a question mark heading into the new year. Ja''Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are still there, but Tyler Boyd and Joe Mixon have found riches elsewhere. This is not a team that will win defensive struggles. Their offence will have to win them games.<br>                  <strong>6. Houston Texans</strong> - More than willing to admit my errors, I had the Texans ranked 1th heading into last season. With a rooke coach and quarterback, I didn''t see a lot of upside. The turnaround has been rapid, and they bring more pieces to the party this year. They acquired offensive assets from two of their AFC rivals without losing any marquee players over the off-season. They''re solid on both sides of the ball.<br>                  <strong>5. Philadelphia Eagles</strong> - I''m not buying the uncertainty in Philadelphia. Head coach Nick Sirianni''s tenure has been up in the air since last season''s collapse and before the coach/quarterback offensive squabbles became a controversy. Their All-Pro center Jason Kelce has retired and there''s been a large turnover of personnel. But I have a lot of belief in GM Howie Roseman and his ability to construct an NFL roster to compete with the best.<br>                    <strong>4. Detroit Lions</strong> - The guffaws came from all corners when Dan Campbell took over the team in 2021. Who''s laughing now? They''ve brought back all their offensive starters and added some talent to the defensive side, which was their achilles last year. The large majority of their games are indoors, which plays to their strengths. It''s a good time to be a Lions fan, if there''s any amongst us.<br>                  <strong>3. San Francisco 49ers</strong> - While the Brandon Aiyuk contract has finally been resolved, the Trent Williams impasse lingers. Despite being 36, he''s the best offensive lineman in football and wants his salary to reflect that. Like Dallas, this is a top-heavy team with a small portion of players eating up a big chunk of their salary cap. If the Williams holdout is settled, which I expect it to be, the 49ers will once again be playing deep into January.<br>                  <strong>2. Baltimore Ravens</strong> - Like everyone else, I''m anxious to see Derrick Henry in the same backfield as Lamarr Jackson. The Ravens have won more than 75 percent of their games since Lamarr became their starter.  Barring an injury, they will no doubt return to the playoffs, where they have fallen short for several years running.<br>                 <strong>1. Kansas City Chiefs</strong> - The Chiefs have won the last two Super Bowls and three of the last five. Despite some defections on defence, they''ve added some speed at wide receiver to help stretch the field. Players come and go, but the pillars of the team (Patrick Mahones, Andy Reid, Chris Jones) remain intact with it a legitimate chance to achieve what until now has been unachievable, the threepeat.                 <br><br>                 That''s kinda, sorta how I see it. What you say? Whatever you throw at me, I''ve been called worse.                 <br><br>                 Everyone knows the rules. There are only two new faces and they''ve been briefed. Don''t forget your Survivor pick. Place it underneath all your game selections. Eric "the Disruptor" Matthies has been calling for a host of changes to scoring, format, you name it. To quiet his cavils, he''s taken over selecting the Point Spread (PS) Game of the Week. This may only be a temporary appeasement. Remember, you have to pick the PS game twice; one for the outright winner and one with the point spread factored in.                  <br><br>                 One of our Irish contingent in the competition, Rowdy Roudy, is by trade a graphic designer / illustrator. He is in the process of developing a website to help streamline NFL Pickem operations. In the future, everything will flow through it; Wednesday Reports, team selections, standings, Survivor results, method of payment. As I say, it is in development, but I will keep everyone apprised of its launch date. Hosting costs, which I expect to be nominal, will be underwritten by entry fees. I will provide further details in the coming weeks.                 <br><br>                 There are 34 of us. The entry fee is $95. I haven''t worked out first, second, third prize money as I''m running late. The Survivor winner receives $340.                  <br><br>                 Questions? Comments? Concerns? Drop them my way.                  <br><br>                 I think that''s everything for now. Good luck all.                              <br><br>                 Regards,                 <br><br>         <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>         <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>       </p>       </div>              </div>   </div> </div>     </body> </html>');

We''ve got a large enough sample size to know the good from the bad, the contenders from the pretenders, the haves from the have nots, the wheat from the chaff, and/or any other binary you care to use. There aren''t as many good teams in the NFC as there are in the AFC, but here, in no particular order, are the 14 teams I think will be playing post-season ball.               </p>                              <table id="postTable">                 <thead style="font-weight: bold;">                   <tr>                     <td><strong>NFC</strong></td>                     <td><strong>AFC</strong></td>                   </tr>                 </thead>                 <tbody>                     <tr>                       <td>Detroit</td>                       <td>Kansas City</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>Green Bay</td>                       <td>Baltimore</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>Washington</td>                       <td>LA Chargers</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>San Francisco</td>                       <td>Buffalo</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>Philadelphia</td>                       <td>Houston</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>Atlanta</td>                       <td>Pittsburgh</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>Minnesota</td>                       <td>Cincinnati</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>(OLI)</td>                       <td>(OLI)</td>                     </tr>                     <tr>                       <td>LA Rams</td>                       <td>Denver</td>                     </tr>                 </tbody>               </table>               <p>                                          It''s hard to leave the Rams on the outside looking in because they have a good coach and a good quarterback and a number of other quality pieces on offence. But at 4-4, they are already two games behind Minnesota. The Viking schedule for the next six games is @ Jacksonville, @ Tennessee, Chicago, Arizona, Atlanta, @ Chicago. I can easily see them going 4-2, even 5-1, which gets them to 10 or 11 wins with five weeks to go, which should be more than enough, despite the Vikings endless propensity to make all things as difficult as humanly possible. Philadelphia, who I have pegged as one of the three wildcard teams from the NFC, is in itself a wildcard. I don''t trust their coach or their quarterback. What they do have in their favour is playing the NFC East with the Cowboys and the Giants, Saquon Barkley, a steadily improving defence under Vic Fangio, and six wins in the bag.                <br><br>                             As for the AFC, I think six of the seven teams have already booked their tickets. I can''t even tell you why I think the 4-5 Bengals on their way to 4-6 after Sunday''s tilt with Baltimore squeeze their way in, besides the fact I have faith in Joe Burrow. When he''s healthy, he''s great. I think Zach Taylor and a porous defence are the Brengal''s two biggest liabilities. This is, of course, assuming all things are equal. And as we all know, all things are not equal. Someone is going to lose their quarterback for a few games or a wide receiver for the year changing the trajectory of their season. We don''t know who it will be, but it will befall someone. As for the SuperBowl, at this point in time, barring unexpected injuries, suspensions or otherwise, there are only four teams that can win the Lombardi - Kansas City, Baltimore, Buffalo and Detroit. Even without Hutchison on defence, Detroit has proven again and again, they are better, stronger, nastier and can score more points in a game than any other team in the NFC. With the Lions steamrolling their way to home field advantage, no one comes into Detroit and beats the Lions. Only someone who''s followed the NFL for the past thirty years can recognize the absurdity of how that sounds. The AFC is considerably more complicated and competitive. Even Pittsburgh and the LA Chargers will be tough outs because they field such formidable deences.                <br><br>                             Dennis Allen was fired in New Orleans. No surprise there. When you lose to Carolina, that happens. Dennis Allen was a defensive coordinator and he''ll probably get hired to serve in that capacity for some team next year. But he''s not a head coach. Being a good offensive or defensive coordinator does not mean you''ll be a good head coach. Josh McDaniels was a good offensive coordinator. He was not a good head coach. Steve Spagnuola is currently a great defensive coordinator. He wasn''t a good head coach. The list of acclaimed coordinators who have taken an offence or defence to great heights one year, only too fail miserably from their role they have been chosen to lead, is long  It''s a tough job and regardless of how talented you may be in one area of the game, there''s no guarantee the success achieved on one side of the ball will translate into a winning vision or direction for a team. Dennis Allen is the first of what could and should be a slew of head coaches to be fired, although most  will probably be given until the end of the year. Doug Pederson in Jacksonville, Antonio Pierce in Las Vegas, Matt Eberflus in Chicago, Zach Taylor in Cincinnati, Brian Daboll in New York. That''s for starters, before we even get to Mike McCarthy, Nick Sirianni, Dave Canales, and Mike McDaniels. Because Brian Callahan is in his first year, he''ll get a pass, but the chasm that exists between good head coaches (Andy Reid, John Harbaugh, Sean McVay, Jim Harbaugh, Mike Tomlin) and bad head coaches (any of the names listed above) is vast. A good head coach is, if not more important, than a good quarterback. It''s tough to win the big prize with just one of the two.                <br><br>                             <strong>After ten years left unclaimed, not one, but two people, fielded perfect records last week to claim the free steak dinner. 17-0, including the ps and the db.</strong>               <br><br>                             <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Matt and Brett, congratulations!</strong></span>                <br><br>                             <strong>AK, also known as Adam Kenny</strong>, was blotched fourth-down in Seattle from making it three. To give you any idea of how faint the chances of selecting a perfect week is, outside the fact of correctly picked the outright winner in 15 games, consider that no team since they started keeping records on these things back in 1970, had ever won after getting out-gained an opponent by more than 150 yards, having the opponent rush for more than 150 yards and lose the turnover battle. Teams that had those numbers on their side were 250-0 until Sunday. Then came Dennis Allen. Any given Sunday is more than a cliche.                <br><br>                             Matt is my nephew on Vancouver Island. We''ll have more than ample time to arrange a steak dinner, if not in the next few months, at some other time down the line. Brett has been the Pickem for several years, but we never personally met. He may have already decided after reading the schlop I serve up every Wednesday, he doesn''t care to know me, let alone share a free steak dinner with me. We''ll talk. All that said, huge kudos to you guys. As I say, the free steak dinner was on offer for anyone who put up a perfect score for more than a decade. This is the first time it''s happened.                <br><br>                            This is written on Tuesday because that''s when the Wednesday Report is now written and Tuesday, November 5 is a big day; one of the biggest days of my life and all I can do is sit on the sidelines looking in. Not meaning to be too bombastic, but to steal a line from Gladiator, the decisions Americans make on Tuesday will "echo into eternity". Yeah, the stakes are high. We can only hope they make the right decision.

More than half of the games were one score games with a handful coming down to last-minute make-or-break drives. Thank God, I''m not a gambler. The Pickem is enough to get my blood pressure up. If I had real coin riding on these games, I''d be on heart medication. I could have easily gotten 7 or 8 in the Pickem this week, but a number of games broke my way. Who knows? Maybe it''s my year. Maybe it''s Detroit''s year.               <br><br>               By most metrics, Jared Goff has been in the bottom half of quarterbacking the past three weeks. During that span, he''s either fumbled or been picked once for every ten dropbacks. That would spell doom for most teams, but the Detroit Lions aren''t like most teams. They’ve not only survived this stretch, but they’ve gone 3-0 while scoring the most points in the NFL over that time. In a league dominated by quarterbacks—where dominant QB play is viewed as a prerequisite to winning a championship—Detroit has managed to build an offense that can be QB-proof if it has to be. Can you recall a team throwing five picks and still winning a game? I can''t recall a game where a team has thrown five picks, let alone won it. Three, yeah, there were a couple of those this past weekend. How ya doing, Sam Darnold? Four. Steve Grogan and "Two-fisted" Tommy Kramer probably had more than one of those games, but in either instance, I can guarantee you the Patriots or the Vikings came out on the short end of the stick. But back to my point, if the Lions can win after losing the turnover battle by three, (Stroud threw a couple picks himself), their margin for error is considerably higher than any other run-of-the-mill contender. The Lions can adapt and shape-shift depending on the situation. It can win a shootout or slugfest or any game in-between. The Lions might be the one team that can win regardless of  the team''s quarterback performance. As for Houston, the lustre was worn off the Texans we were all dazzled by last year. Missing your two biggest receivers and a non-existent running game can do that. They''re 6-4 and a slam dunk for the playoffs by virtue of beating up teams in the AFC South, but a long way from being considered a threat in the highly competitive AFC.                <br><br>               There are three games in the AFC this weekend that will go a long way to determining the playoff pecking order: Baltimore @ Pittsburgh, Kansas City @ Buffalo, Cincinnati @ LA Chargers. Entering Week 11, Pittsburgh hasn''t played any teams in their own division. That means, two games against Baltimore, two games against Cincinnati and another pair with Cleveland. Their only other game outside the AFC North in the final eight weeks is Kansas City. That my friends, is no easy schedule. Division games are always difficult,  and I think Baltimore and Cincinnati are better than Pittsburgh, regardless of what their current record says they are. The Steelers have seven wins in the bag and another three would get them to the postseason,  but I''d favour their opposition in every one of the games, excluding the pair against Cleveland. Pittsburgh is never going to blow you out. That''s not their game. Although the switch from Justin Fields to Russell Wilson has improved the passing game, jump balls to George Pickens and moon balls to Mike Williams are not sustainable on a week-to-week basis against better competition. They have a good defence and they won''t beat themselves, something you always get from a well-coached team.                <br><br>               Kansas City can all but nail down home-field advantage with a win in Buffalo. Easier said than done. Kansas City has conjured up more than its fair share of magic to maintain its perfect record. A different call, a different bounce, a different decision by the opposing coach and this team could be 7-2 or 6-3. Spagnuola''s defence will keep the Chiefs in every game while Mahones is good enough to offset all the litany of offensive deficiencies. Kareem Hunt has been a savior for the Chiefs running game, which will get a boost with the return of Isiah Pacheco. However, it''s the third of the AFC triple-header that I find most intriguing.                <br><br>               The way I figure it, there''s three teams (Chargers, Broncos, Bengals) vying for two spots. The Chargers have had a couple things go their way so far. One, they’ve had the easiest schedule in the NFL. And two, only Buffalo is doing better than them in the turnover department. Their defense has been very good. Quarterback Justin Herbert is playing well, and they are well-coached. The Chargers are in a nice spot with eight games left. There’s a scenario that could haunt the dreams of Broncos fans in which Sunday’s blocked field goal against the Chiefs ends up being the play that costs them a playoff spot. But Sean Payton’s team has overachieved. Denver’s defense has played well, and rookie quarterback Bo Nix is playing far better than he did early in the season.               <br><br>               But I’m not going to give up on the Bengals until I absolutely have to. They’ve been arguably the unluckiest team in the NFL. Let the game this past Thursday be exhibit one. Cincinnati is 1-5 in games decided by seven points or fewer. Only the Jaguars have a worse winning percentage in such games, but Jacksonville sucks, plays in an easy division against weaker competition and wasn''t worth the mention. Joe Burrow is playing at an elite level, and Cincy’s passing game is going to keep the team competitive every week. If the Bengals can find some answers on defense (and that’s a big if!), they are going to have a chance down the stretch.                <br><br>               What’s fun about this is that the Bengals play the Chargers in Week 11, and they play the Broncos in Week 17. Meanwhile, the Broncos and Chargers play each other in Week 16. In other words, we’ve got some high-stakes matchups coming up that will determine who gets in. Analytics, for what it''s worth currently gives the Chargers an 83 percent chance, the Broncos a 53 percent chance, and the Bengals a 32 percent chance of making the playoff field. Things can obviously change, but right now, this three-team race for two spots in the AFC is one of the juiciest subplots of the final eight weeks. I don''t think Pittsburgh has punched their ticket to the dance just yet. Week 18 - Cincinnati at Pittsburgh. Just saying. Predictions? I think the Steelers, Chargers and Bengals get in and the Broncos are the odd team out.               <br><br>               If that''s the way it plays out, here are your quarterbacks in the AFC playoffs - Patrick Mahones, LaMarr Jackson, Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, CJ Stroud and Russell Wilson. You''d be hard-pressed to find a more impressive quarterback list for a Conference championship.               <br><br>               Let''s get some banter going or the Wednesday Reports will become highly ridiculous. Been pretty mainstream so far  We''ll go stream of consciousness.

I didn''t give it any hype last week and for that I apologize, but Canada had its national football championship on Sunday. the Grey Cup. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were playing in its 5th consecutive Grey Cup. They lost their third in a row. They were leading 10-9 at the half and then it all went south, losing 41-24. Bomber quarterback Zach Collaros, once again waited until the last game of the year to serve up one of his worst of the season, although there was lots of blame to go around; coaches, defence, special teams, mascots, cheerleaders, fans. Never content to let another city outshine its own humility, Winnipeg is gunning for Buffalo as the only team to lose its national football championship four times in a row.               <br><br>               In the NFL, those same Buffalo Bills took a big step to getting back to the big game after a 30-year hiatus. They beat previously undefeated Kansas City by letting their best player win it for them on a crucial fourth down play.  Even if the play didn''t work, it was the correct decision. Putting the game in Patrick Mahomes hands, which the Bills know better than anyone, is never a good idea. The Bills won because they weren''t afraid of failing, and for that, they were rewarded. People could apply that same lesson to their own  lives. In the other two big AFC tilts, Baltimore did what it''s done four times this year; find ways to lose a game. In this case, 12 penalties, five turnovers, and a botched game-tying two-point conversion in the final minute. Yes, missed field goals are turnovers. You turned the ball over on downs. That is a turnover. Anyway, I strongly contend that Baltimore is a far superior team to Pittsburgh. They may have dimmed their chances of winning the AFC Central, but they remain uber-dangerous, on the road or at home come playoff time. As for the Bengals/Chargers game, which would pull me away from the Bombers dumpster fire happening on the other channel, the Chargers proved they aren''t the same old Chargers. For years, hell decades, squandering a three-touchdown lead in the second half would hardly be a blip in the team’s long history of debilitating losses. This year, it is the Chargers not being the team that missed two field goals and gave up the game-winning touchdown with seconds remaining. When it looked like overtime was imminent, Jim Harbaugh did what Sean McDermott did earlier in the day; put the game in the hands of the team''s best player. Still can''t get a read on the Chargers. They looked like world-beaters in the first half, only to mail in a feckless effort in the second half, minus the last minute-heroics. I refuse to count Cincinnati out until they are officially eliminated. Joe Burrow is too good not to be in the playoffs.                <br><br>               The Dallas Cowboys lost again on Monday night. As far as recent, lopsided, embarrassing Cowboys losses go, this one barely registers. A piece of metal fell from the roof before the game, which is somehow so fitting and emblematic of the entire Cowboy year. At 3-7, the Cowboys’ 2024 season is dead. What we don’t know is their plan for 2025 and beyond. Mike McCarthy iis in the final year of his contract. Most people assumed that if this season didn’t go well, Jerry Jones would pull the plug on McCarthy. Don''t count on it. For Jones, the priority isn''t building a Super Bowl contender. It’s about Jones enjoying his experience as the owner of the Dallas Cowboys and making boatloads of money in the process. That means employing a coach who understands the setup. Someone who isn’t going to challenge him. Someone who isn’t going to ask for influence on personnel decisions. Someone who is going to be OK with Jones holding media scrums after every game and saying outlandish things during his weekly radio appearances. Head coach of the Cowboys is not a job for everyone, and might well not be a job that attracts top candidates.               <br><br>               Which brings us back to McCarthy. Returning really doesn’t feel that far-fetched. Jones stuck with Jason Garrett for 10 years even though Garrett produced only two playoff wins. Why? Not because Jones thought Garrett was the best man for the job, but because he was comfortable with Garrett as his head coach. Jones could easily rationalize bringing McCarthy back. He could explain that only the Chiefs won more regular-season games than the Cowboys from 2021 to 2023. That the team was hit with the injury bug and got unlucky in 2024. That McCarthy is still the best man for the job and just needs some more time to work with Dak Prescott to get them over the hump. I can totally see this happening. Can’t you? I’m not saying it’s going to play out this way, but when you hear McCarthy bluster about this and that in the weeks ahead, just remember: In Dallas, it’s not about winning. It’s about Jerry. That’s the one thing that’s not going to change.               <br><br>               Sean Payton is arrogant and can be more than a little annoying. He seems to think he’s god’s gift to football, and he will tell you that he thinks he’s god’s gift to football. He''s so smug that anyone outside of Denver hoped his second head-coaching job would take him down a peg or two. Last season was a mess, and then Payton spent the 12th pick in the draft on an over-aged quarterback. All the pieces were in place for disaster. Trouble is, Sean Payton is a good coach. BoNix has outperformed expectations and not all of that is Bo Nix. Caleb Williams has underperformed in Chicago and not all of that is Caleb Williams. The same goes for Anthony Richardson. Denver''s over/under win total was 5.5. After Week 11, the Broncos are 6-5. Simply put, player development is an important part of good coaching. I’m not telling you that the Broncos are a Super Bowl contender, but they have exceeded expectations. And Payton deserves the credit. If asked, he''d probably tell you that.               <br><br>               Netflix has a special coming out on Aaron Rodgers in December. You have to imagine when they gave this project the green light, this wasn''t the scenario they envisioned. They saw the Jets being good and a film crew tagging along chronicling the wondrous things Rodgers was doing to make the Jets a championship-calibre team. Does anyone want to hear one minute of Rodgers, let alone a two-hour documentary, at this point? Until recently, Pat McAfee would give Aaron an hour a week to talk about whatever he wanted: shoot down the coach, throw teammates under the bus, conspiracy theories, his favourite breakfast cereal. Not even Pat wants to talk to him now. He''s a disaster. He''s in the final stage of quarterbacking where getting rid of the ball before he gets hit is more important than the results of the play. Here are the winning percentages of past Jets starters: Zach Wilson - ,364, Sam Darnold - ,342, Aaron Rodgers - .273. Sit down, you phoney. He led anyone who would listen, he''d lead the Jets to the promised land. He''s a fraud. He brought along all his former friends and players, got the coach fired, and earlier this week, got the GM fired. One the best defences in the league decided they tired of the whining and are now middle of the pack or worse. Has there been any accountability? Of course not. People have already begun speculating whether he''ll be back next year. I don''t know if he''ll be back after their bye. See, this is where he presents the phantom injury that prevents him from playing out the rest of the year. He can blame it on the turf at Metlife. When he couldn''t play last year, he pined because he couldn''t show New Yorkers how spectacular he was. Now that they see what a huckster and fraud he is, he wants to back out of the limelight as quickly as he can. Come on smart guy. You''re so well-read you have to tell everybody about it all the time. Tell us how you single-handedly created the conflagration that is the Jets? Maybe he can work for the new Trump administration. Be the ambassador for ayawaska.                <br><br>               Regards,               <br><br>               <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>               <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

By now, teams have a pretty good idea of who they are; what they do well and what they don''t do well. For a big chunk of the league sitting there with two, three or four wins, with hopes of the post-season long in the rearview mirror, it''s the realization that what they do well is insufficient to make up for their multitude of deficiencies and all the things they do poorly. For about 18 other teams, with six weeks left in the season, although most teams only have five games remaining, it''s crunch time.                <br><br>               The NFC West and the NFC South are the only divisions where we don''t have a clear idea of who is going to represent them in the playoffs. In the South, it''ll either be Atlanta (6-5) or Tampa Bay (5-6). Atlanta won the head-to-head series 2-0, which gives them an outsized advantage to winning the division, but their next two games are against the Chargers and the Vikings, where they will be underdogs, and another against the Commanders in Week 17, which could very easily be a loser leaves town match. In other words, no playoffs for the loser. If the Falcons can win one of those three, and win their three others playing scrap-heap teams waiting for the season to end, they''ll end up at 10-7. That being the case, Tampa would essentially have to win out and finish at 11-6. With the exception of playing the Chargers in Week 15, their remaining schedule is cakewalk easy. Despite being a game behind and losing the first tie-breaker in deciding division champs, which essentially gives Atlanta a two-game advantage, I''d still favor the Bucs. I have no faith in the Falcons. They have no defence and a quarterback who throws a pretty ball, but can''t move. The Bucs, on the other hand, have a good defence and an offence that continues to move the ball without Godwin and often without Evans.                <br><br>               In the NFC West, we have four teams separated by one game in the standings. The Seahawks and Cardinals are 6-5. The Rams and 49ers are 5-6. The latter two are the sexy teams, but I can''t see it happening for either of them. The 49ers have too many injuries, a diminished McCaffrey and a brutal schedule, starting in Buffalo this weekend. Many people are unprepared to call the 49ers dead until officially eliminated. I''m declaring them dead. The Rams are clinging to life-support. They forgot to show up against the Dolphins three weeks ago, and it hasn''t gotten better since. If Stafford has time to throw with Cupp and Pacua on the outside, he''ll carve up defences. Unfortunately, he never has time. Let''s say they go 2-1 in games outside the division against the Saints, Bills and Jets, they''d still have to go 3-0 in their remaining games against each of the division foes and have a number of things fall their way. I don''t see that happening. Which leaves us the Seahawks or the Cardinals. A couple of weeks ago, Seattle had the longest odds of any team in the NFC West. After wins against the 49ers and Cardinals, the Seahawks are in first place. The Seahawks will win with their defence. The Cardinals will win because of their offence. Given the choice, I''d favour the defence, although if Arizona wins in Minnesota this week, I could change my mind. I love Minnesota, but they are not a 9-2 team. They finished three games on the road 3-0, but they could have lost all of them. They''ll make the playoffs as a wildcard themselves, and will have a huge stake in who else gets in the NFC, with games against Arizona, Atlanta, Seattle, and Green Bay.                <br><br>               So, as a complete aside, I''m talking to the Disruptor last night. We''re regaling in the Winnipeg Jets unlikely victory over the Minnesota Wild, which takes them to a league-leading 18-4 record for the year. For those of you not in the know, we''re talking NHL hockey. Regardless, no small potatoes. Anyway, I also have my eye on the Chargers/Ravens game happening on the other channel. I say I like the Ravens decision to go for the two-point conversion after taking a seven-point lead in the fourth quarter. You get it, you''re up two scores. You miss, you''re still up seven. (They end up missing it, but remain up seven points) The Disruptor, by his very nature, has to take a different tact, saying he''d prefer to kick the extra-point to go up eight, forcing the Charger to get a touchdown and a two-point convert. I counter by saying it''s still a one-score game. He says. "Not really. Because the two-point convert isn''t a sure thing and I like to have points in the bag" and something or other about eight points not really being a one-score game. I could and should have said fair point, but I didn''t. I said, "It''s the fourth quarter. It''s a good place to be in the fourth quarter", in a slightly heated manner. I could have, but didn''t mention that Baltimore had scored on three consecutive drives and it looked like LA might only have two more possessions. Next thing I know, he''s talking Marshawn Lynch and Seattle not giving him the ball a second time at the goal-line in their ill-fated Super Bowl agsinst the Patriots. I''m trying to draw a parallel between the two when he wants to go into a larger discussion of analytics and its flawed ways. For the record, I agree. Coaches are way ready to go for it in fourth-down in the first-half, and pass up an an easy three, but that''s not the discussion I wanted to have. That''s a much longer discussion to have in-person over beers rather than on the phone at 9 p.m. Anyway, rather than saying that, I hung up. Mid-sentence. No goodbye. No, I gotta go. Nada. It was very rude of me and I have since sent a conciliatory note to Eric explaining that I am a deeply flawed individual who lets his emotions get the better of him on occasion, especially when talking sports. So to make a long paragraph short, am I a prick and/or do you agree going for the two-point concert to go up nine in the fourth quarter is a good decision? I strongly maintain, yes, given what your team is and how they have been moving the ball. Anyway, let''s leave the fourth-down decision to go for it on your own 18 in the first half to another time. The Disruptor may have a slightly different recollection of events.                <br><br>               I know I''m the only guy that likes him, but Belichick on the Manning Cast of Monday Night Football is very entertaining and a great way to improve your knowledge of the game; offensive and defensive alignments, the different zone coverages. the backstory of "Omaha", which for a period of time, Peyton Manning appeared to be calling out on every play while in Denver. I don''t get TSN+, but the segment, minus commercials, is available on Youtube every Monday. He''s an absolute encyclopedia of all things football, and actually quite funny. I recognise this is a rehab job he''s doing to improve his likeability and prove to everybody, including team owners, that he''s not the mean, menacing person he''s portrayed as. I''m kind of hoping he stays in the broadcast and podcast business. I can''t imagine him anywhere else but Foxborough.                <br><br>               A full heaping of football on Thursday with back-to-back-to-back games, with only the evening game of Miami @ Green Bay having playoff implications. There''s another missable game on Friday as well.                <br><br>               Regards,               <br><br>               <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>               <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

After this week, the byes are done and it''s a full slate each week until the end of the year. Just a few thoughts on the past week.               <br><br>               I still can''t believe Philadelphia went into Baltimore and beat the Ravens. LaMarr was 23-1 against NFC teams. Stats like that often don''t tell the whole story, and for me, it was a case of under-estimating the Eagles and over-hyping the Ravens. Saquon Barkley has been great, but the Eagle offence is very much much on par with their offence last year. More running and less passing, but numbers-wise, very consistent with the overall offensive numbers they put up last year. The big difference has been the defence. Vic Fangio, the defensive coordinator, who I touted early in the season, has transformed the unit. After getting run out of Miami for working the defence too hard, he took his hard-nosed approach to Philly. The players have responded. After a 2-2 start, they''ve ripped off nine wins in a row. Barkley and the offence are grabbing the headlines, but the defence is more than carrying its load. The strength and conditioning of the team which came into question last year, when they repeatedly lost second-half leads, has the best plus/minus numbers in the fourth quarter this year. Every NFL game is a battle. But if you''re stronger in the final fifteen minutes, you''re going to win the close games. I didn''t see anyone beating Detroit in the NFC, but this past weekend was an eye-opener. Detroit has a one-game advantage and they better keep it, because I can''t see Goff and company going to Philadelphia in January and winning. Whereas, for the first time, I can see someone going into Detroit and beating the Lions. And it would be a terrible match-up for Detroit. A run-first team going against a depleted and suspect defence. Or a run-first team going against one of the best defences in the league that''s getting better as the season moves forward. You want to be peaking in December and January, not October and November.                 <br><br>               For Baltimore, it was more of what we''ve seen in all their losses this year; self-inflicted wounds. Penalties, turnovers, giving up big plays and special teams. When this team is on, they can move the ball at will. More than enough to offset their deficiencies on defence. Truth be told, that was probably Baltimore''s best defensive performance this year. Baltimore outgained the Eagles by more than a hundred yards and held Hurts to only 120 yards passing. If someone was to tell me those would be the final numbers for the game, I couldn''t imagine anything but a Ravens victory. But the truth is, the Eagles have had more running yards than passing yards for the past five games. That sounds like 1970-type football. I keep thinking Baltimore will clean up their game, but we''re in the back-half of the season. That is who they are. What I didn''t see was the calamitous downfall of the best field goal kicker in history. Justin Tucker was Mr. Automatic. He had a better than 92 percent success rate for field-goals under 60 yards for his entire career. On Sunday, he missed two field goals and an extra-point in a 24-19 loss. He''s missed eight field-goals this year. People have been calling for Baltimore to bring in another kicker, but Harbaugh maintains he''s sticking with Tucker. What does this all mean? I can''t see Baltimore overcoming Pittsburgh in the AFC Central, so they''ll be on the road for the playoffs. I don''t think that sinks the ship. They lost to Kansas City in the AFC Championship at home last year, for what good that did. I just can''t rid myself of believing Baltimore is the best team in the AFC. Evidence, such as wins and losses, don''t support that belief. I, true to my form, remain steadfastly stubborn. I can''t quit Baltimore. Seeding and who goes where and when will tell us a lot.               <br><br>               Despite not selling Baltimore, I''m still not buying Pittsburgh. They put up more than 500 yards against Cincinnati and scored 44 points. Still not buying. It was the Bengals after all. A defence that has been consistently shredded week in/week out. Rusell Wilson is 36 and looking everyday of it. Put a little heat on him and that bird is cooked. Harris and Warren don''t strike fear into any defence. Crowd the box and force Wilson to beat you. The defence is good and Tomlin will make sure they don''t beat themselves, but this is not a championship-calibre team. They play to their potential. Unfortunately for them, that ceiling isn''t too high. I could be proven wrong, but I can easily see them being one and done in the playoffs. I do feel sorry for Joe Burrow and have officially given up any hope of them making it to the postseason.  You only get so many chances with a franchise quarterback who is healthy and in his prime. Burrow has been fantastic this season—completing 68 percent of his passes with 30 touchdowns and five interceptions. A legit MVP-caliber performance—had he only gotten a little more help from the toothless Bengals. The good news for Bengals fans is he''s 28.  The bad news is that the rest of the roster needs a complete overhaul, from the coach on down.  Bottom line: This was probably the last run for the trio of Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, and Higgins, who will be lost in free agency.                <br><br>               This is the worst Chiefs team that Patrick Mahomes has been part of. The script on Black Friday followed a familiar pattern. The Chiefs once again stunk, but somehow came away with a victory against a lesser opponent. This time, a botched snap by the Raiders in the dying moments with a field goal to win it. I''m not going to bore you with out-sized one-score victories and their abysmal plus/minus that is more representative of a seven win team than an 11 win team, but suffice it to say, if this team had any other quarterback, I’m not sure it would even sniff the playoffs, let alone compete for a Super Bowl. But the Chiefs are 11-1, which means they’re in the driver’s seat for the top seed in the AFC. If they hold onto that spot, they’ll get a bye in the wild-card round, and the road to the Super Bowl will go through Arrowhead. The Chiefs would be favorites against any AFC opponent if they’re playing at home in the playoffs. As for me? I don’t really believe in them. How can you?  Do they possess some special magic that allows them to win close games? No, they''ve been exceedingly lucky. But they’ve got time to figure things out. If Mahomes is healthy and the Chiefs have the no. 1 seed, they are going to have as good a shot as any other AFC team to get to the Super Bowl.               <br><br>               That''s it. That''s all  I''m out. Until next week.                <br><br>               Regards,               <br><br>               <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>               <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

Don''t kid yourself, the Chiefs won''t let this opportunity slip away. Although they wished they could have banked some of their good fortune through 13 weeks, the truth is they needed all of it to be in the position they are. It won''t matter. They simply don''t have the talent to beat Baltimore or Buffalo, one of whom I fully expect to be the other team standing when we get to the conference championship.. That, provided the Chiefs don''t play one of those teams after their bye in the first round of the playoffs. They won''t beat either of those teams. It''s been a good run, a great run, but will fail short of being truly historic by failing to win a third Super Bowl title in a row. They''re going to Cleveland this weekend, which is 3-10. The Chiefs are giving 4 points. That''s about all you need to know.                <br><br>               Despite losing 44-42, in one of the great games or the season, my belief in the Bills isn''t shaken. Yeah, the defence stunk playing on a fast-track in LA. The only fast tracks in the AFC playoffs are Houston, and in long-shot odds, Indianapolis. Or Miami, who is statistically, still alive. None of those teams pose a threat to Buffalo, Baltimore, KC or Pittsburgh. Sean McDermott is a lauded and highly-respected football coach. Doesn''t mean he doesn''t make boneheaded calls. Why did Josh Allen try to push it in from the one in the final minute when the Bills only conceivable way to a highly unlikely victory was retaining their three timeouts? That''s a no brainer. That Joe Brady called it, Sean McDernptt didn''t overrule him and that Josh Allen didn''t audible out of the call speaks badly of all three, but most of all, McDermott. That is his call. He hears all the calls, offensive coordinator Brady relays to Allen, He had the chance to veto it. Instead, he let it play. You can get up to two pass plays in the end zone in eight or nine seconds. You score, or the clock stops. That is situational football. You hear the term bandied about constantly. It''s calls like that that kill you in the playoffs. You don''t need an armchair quarterback in a wheelchair in a foreign country to tell you that.                <br><br>                            As for the Rams, they control their own destiny. Win their remaining four games and they''re in. At San Francisco and New York against the Jets, and then back home for their final two against Arizona and Seattle. The final game against Seattle at home will probably be for the NFC West, although both teams remain alive in the wildcard chase. No one in the NFC playoffs wants to play the Rams. No one, including Detroit and Philadelphia. Philadelphia was shockingly bad in their win against Carolina. They passed for less than 100 yards. They have an MVP in their backfield, two star wideouts, a good offensive line that provides him ample time to throw, and yet they''re 30th in giving up sacks. Jalen Hurts has to start earning that $50 mil a year salary, You can''t hang on to the ball until a receiver runs clear. Being anticipatory and running a receiver into open spots is what a good quarterback can and should do,  The Eagles are 11-2 in spite of him, not because of him. They play Pittsburgh on Sunday. Pittsburgh hasn''t won in Philadelphia since 1955. The Steeler defence won''t afford Hurts the kind of time Carolina did.                <br><br>                            That''s all I made time for. I may be lazy, but I''m honest.                <br><br>                             <strong>For the remainder of the season, it is a response only system.

I recall being clear-headed on Sunday morning when I made my selections, but there was obviously some underlying condition that would compel me to pick Carolina and Las Vegas and a number of other head-scratchers. I haven''t looked at the leaderboard because I fear I''ve done irreparable damage to my chances of winning the league. There are 48 games left, with lots of points on offer. If I close hard, I might have a chance.                <br><br>               A couple things.... Goff has won a game throwing five interceptions and lost a game throwing five touchdowns. What that says is the Lions defence can no longer bail out poor offensive performances. They have too many missing pieces on defence. And the injuries keep coming. They lost a couple more on the back-end and their first major casualty on the offence, David Montgomery. Gibbs is great, but it was the loss of the one-two Montgomery/Gibbs punch that will really hurt the offence. So if Ben Johnson is an offensive genius and Detroit has established itself as a run-first team, why does he call three passes in the first series of the game? Three incompletions later, they''re punting the ball. It didn''t make any sense to me. Perhaps one of you can explain it to me. And Campbell trying an on-side kick with 12 minutes to go when the success rate of recovering on-side kicks was less than seven per cent. This wasn''t analytics or being true to the identity of the team. That was bad-coaching. I fear the Lions peaked in November and are too depleted to win in January. The Bills have scored 30 points or more in eight straight games. Kansas City hasn''t scored 30 points in a game this year. As a sideline, there are only four teams in NFL history that have scored 30+ points for eight straight games. The 2000 Rams, the 2007 and 2010 Patriots, and the 2013 Broncos. None of them won a Super Bowl. Mind you, three of them lost in the Super Bowl. I would be shocked if Buffalo or Baltimore doesn''t represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. Houston and Pittsburgh are not nearly as good as their records say they are. The Chargers are frauds. And the Broncos are a nice comeback story, but they can''t compete with the Bills or the Ravens.                <br><br>                             All indications would say Philadelphia is the best team in the NFC, with the Lions now in full retreat. For me, there are two red flags; Jalen Hurts and Nick Sirianni. I don''t trust either of them. If there''s a bad decision to be made in a playoff game to be had, they would be at the top of my list of would-be candidates. The Eagles are solid up and down the line-up, with great offensive and defensive lines, which allows them to control the line of scrimmage, an MVP-calibre back and a pair of great wideouts. All is cool, but the quarterback and the coach, which are two major cogs in any football operation. Everything was clicking on Sunday against Pittsburgh, which is more an 8-6 team than a 10-4 team, so they looked like a million dollars. The Eagles are a good team and when they play well, they''ll win a lot more than they lose. But they are going to be days when things aren''t going their way, when the ball is not bouncing in their favour. Those times, more than any other, you look for a calm head on the sidelines and a level head calling the play in the huddle. I don''t think either of them fits that mold. In the quarterback / coach quotient, they don''t have a good score. There are few Super Bowl winners without the quarterback-coach combination. Trace it back. Mahomes-Reid, Stafford-McVay, Belichick-Brady. The most recent outlier would be Pederson-Foles, still an awful pill to swallow all these years later.                 <br><br>                             And a couple other things....The Falcons had 24 first-down snaps. They ran the ball on 23 of them. You can''t hide your flawed quarterback. Playing against nearly anyone other than the Raiders and it would have been a loss. Cousins has two years left on a three-year $180 million contract, with lots of dead money for opting out early. Just Eberflus needed someone to teach him how to be a head coach, Caleb Williams is in need of someone to teach him how to be a good NFL quarterback. He looks lost. He was terrible on Monday night. Chicago is a badly-flawed football franchise. Weak ownership. A detached president. They better get their coach right next year or fear losing their franchise quarterback. The Krafts are already contemplating getting rid of their hand-picked successor to the greatest coach in history. If BB had a half-way serviceable starting quarterback instead of Mac Jones in his final years, he''d still be in New England. Have you seen Mac Jones in Jacksonville filling in for Trevor Lawrence? Mind-boggling bad. Tommy DeVito, Tim Boyle, Will Levins, Mac Jones, Jake Haener, Desmond Ritter.

Denver wins against KC and they claim the seventh seed in the AFC. The Super Bowl Champion chiefs are getting 10.5 points. That''s all you need to know. They''re suiting up their entire practice squad and starting Carson Wents, Kansas City has no interest in winning the game. A loss keeps Cincinnati out of the playoffs. Having a weaker team in a field of seven makes their road to the Super Bowl a little bit less perilous.                <br><br>                             In the NFC, we know the teams. We just don''t know who goes where. Yes, Tampa will beat New Orleans and claim the NFC South. They could end up third or fourth seed depending on the outcome of the Seattle / LA Rams game.                <br><br>                            The big game is Minnesota (14-2) at Detroit (14-2). The winner claims the NFC Central, the number one seed in the NFC and a first-round bye. The loser, despite a 14-3 record, falls to the fifth seed. Detroit needs it much more than Minnesota. They don''t want to go to Philadelphia in the playoffs. They are at their best indoors on a fast track with their rabid fans in the stands. But make no doubt about it, the pressure is on them to win this game. For as much the Vikings would like to be the one seed, they''re playing with house money. With Sam Darnold behind center, few had them pegged for the playoffs, let alone top spot in the NFC. Sam has earned himself a pig payday come next year. Anywhere from $45-55 million per year. I can''t see Minnesota letting him go, regardless of how the season ends. What they do with their supposed quarterback in waiting, JJ McCarthy, who was lost for the year and opened the door for Sam, could be interesting. Being on a very manageable five-year rookie contract, the Vikings would be foolish to trade him away.                <br><br>                             As for our little league, John H., Corey and Chris have set themselves in pole positions to take home the winnings. Good luck to all this week. I wish I wouldn''t have squandered my best opportunity to win our competition, but c''est la vie. It''s been fun. I hope you enjoyed it. I''ll announce the winners early next week.                <br><br>                             I think we should have a playoff pool again this year. Let me know if you''re interested. I''ll remind you with the note next week.               <br><br>                             Happy New Year. May 2025 be healthy and prosperous for us all.

Week 1 brought us everything we''ve come to expect from the opening of a new season; the buckled-down , do-your -job, highly efficient performances of Kansas City and Houston, to the mistake-laden, poorly-prepared outings from Cincinnati and Atlanta to the genuinely atrocious, comically-inept of the Carolina and the New York Football Giants. The first week of the season had it all.            <br><br>           Which brings us  a new feature of Wednesday Report: the post <strong>Week 1 Panic Meter</strong>.           <br><br>           <strong>1. Cincinnati Bengals</strong> - They were horrible in every way, shape and form. In what has become the usual in all but one of the first five years of the Zach Talor-coached Bengals, the team lost its opening game. They were ill-prepared, sloppy and dismissive of the Patriots, who were 7.5 point dogs on the road with a rookie coach and a regurgitated, yet largely-functional quarterback. The Bengals are a shadow of their AFC Championship teams from a couple years back and Joe Burrow, despite his claims to the contrary, is not alright. He is either reluctant or unable to throw downfield, which during the Burrow years has been a defining feature of the Bengals offence . They''re 0-1 and heading to Kansas City. In a conference where you may need 10 wins to make the playoffs. they''ll have to go 10-5 the rest of the way. Yeah, I know. It''s Week 1 and this may have been the first action some starters have seen since last year. You''re over-reacting. That''s not the way I see it. They''re going to be 0-2, facing an uphill climb in one of the toughest divisions in football. <br><br>           <strong>2. Green Bay Packers</strong> - This is not-so-much a reflection of their Week 1 performance, as the fact they''ll be without Jordan Love for what could be the next 4-6 weeks. In his place, for at least next week, steps Malik Willis. Tennessee got rid of him in the off-season, when the Titans settled on Will Levins being their starter going forward. If you saw Will Levins against the Bears on Sunday, one can only imagine what the Packers will get from Willis. He was called into action to throw a Hail Mary in the final series against Philadelphia and didn''t even get the pass off. Green Bay will have to find an alternative.  Tannehill, Ridder and Garoppolo. who were all starters at the beginning of last year, are all options and would be an upgrade over Willis. It''s not inconceivable the Packers drop their next four and head to Houston 1-5. After the litany of starting quarterbacks who went down last year, the imperative of having a serviceable back-up QB still hasn''t been heeded by  franchises, including the Packers.<br><br>           <strong>3. Atlanta Falcons</strong> - For however bad Cousins was in his first start in Atlanta, more than an ample serving has to be given to the new coach and the new offensive coordinator. ESPN breaks it down statistically, but the Falcons play-calling and alignment was so coded, Pittsburgh knew what they were doing before the ball was snapped. TJ Watt lived in their backfield and said he was tipped off early in the game to the cadence of the count Cousins was using.  They couldn''t see what was happening? They couldn''t make adjustments? Cousins, head coach Raheem Morris and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson have each been around professional football a long time. That''s completely inexcusable. For all the hype Atlanta has been given, and in particular, this offence, they generated just over 200 yards. They didn''t want to give the head coaching job to Bill Belichick, fearing accountability may be expected. You get what you pay for. In this case, what you never want to be; a high-expectation, low delivery football team.<br><br>            <strong>4. Cleveland Browns</strong> - What do you do with DeShaun Watson? His on-field play is terrible, his off-field sexual assault allegations in Houston continue to come to light, and his fully-guaranteed $255 million contract is the benchmark of bad contracts, although I also said that of Russell Wilson''s Denver contract. Denver eventually unloaded Wilson, but not before eating $80 million of dead money. Do you know what it would cost Cleveland to do the same? $172 million. It would be one thing if this was a blip, but he''s been bad since he arrived in Cleveland, with no sign of him improving or ever regaining the magic he displayed in Houston. Joe Flacco came off the couch to save the Browns season last year.  Can Jameis Winston come off the bench to do it in 2024? He could get his chance sooner rather than later.<br><br>            <strong>5. Carolina / NY Giants</strong> - It''s difficult to put either of these teams on the Panic Meter because so little is expected of them. It''s hard to fathom how far these teams have fallen. Sam Darnold, playing on his fourth team in five years, looked like a star in craving up the Giants defence. Derek Carr, who''s best before date expired five years ago, did his best Drew Brees impression in slicing up the Panthers. The Giants let Saquon Barkley join the Eagles because they didn''t want to put up the additional $2 million a year it would take to keep him. He scored three touchdowns for the Eagles in his first game. The Giants started a number of no names to replace him who did squat. You don''t let great players walk over $2 million per annum. The salary cap for NFL teams is more than $255 million a season. They can afford more than $40 million a year for a quarterback who can''t play, but can''t put up an additional two mill a year to keep one of the great running backs in the game. Carolina is a "don''t go" zone. You know why Dave Canales is the head coach of Carolina? Because they couldn''t find anyone else. Who wants to coach a dismal team with no upside in a small market with an owner who wants to run the organization, despite having no knowledge of the game? I can understand Canales taking the job because he wants to make a name for himself. The trouble is he''ll come out of the Panther experience so maligned he''ll never get a second chance to be a head coach.           <br><br>           There was a bunch of other note-worthy stuff. The rookie quarterbacks were average at best. The Arizona defence gave up 14 plays of 20 or more yards. Frankly, that''s unbelievable. I must have heard that wrong. Doug Pederson pulled just enough buffon-like moves to cost the Jags the game in Miami. Tyree gets handcuffed. Dak gets paid. Rodgers didn''t look half as bad as I thought he would.            <br><br>           <strong>(The Unknown Football fact)</strong><br>           The Sports Broadcasting Act (1961) prohibits the NFL from holding games from Friday after 5;00 p.m. from the second week of September to the second week of December in deference to High School Football.            <br><br>           That''s all I got time for. More than half of the league is out of the Survivor Series after Week 1, largely because Cincinnati decided to mail it in. I was going to say I''ll try and do better next time, but I know I have appointments Monday morning and Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon, which will seriously cut into getting anything down. I promise you the three Ss: Standing, Schedule, Survivor.           <br><br>           Check your score. I''m as mistake-free as AI.           <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

It''s important. Thank you.</strong>            <br><br>           Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL. I wish I would have kept my old Wednesday Reports. Not because of the fine writing, but every now and again there is a nugget of useful information that can be applied to the current NFL. It must have been at least six years ago, but at the time I wrote that ESPN, by scouring through records for the last 20 years, had found that Week 2 of the season featured more upsets and underdogs winning outright and/or covering than any other week of the year. Their theory, simple as it was, was that early in the season, oddsmakers were basing numbers more on past performance (what the team had done the previous season) than on current analysis and indicators. Ergo, if you were good last year you''ll be good this year, and concurrently, if you were bad last year you''ll be bad this year. That, of course, is an oversimplification, but suffice it to say, Week 2 was a good week to go db hunting. Five of a possible eights dbs won outright and they covered in two of the other three.           <br><br>           Case and point, New Orleans. They have a mediocre quarterback in Derek Carr. Dennis Allen is a head coach with a winning percentage around .350 (roughly 6-11 per season): a very low number in the Wednesday Report QB/HC matrix, which I frequently see as the barometer of a good football team. Overall, an aging group with not a lot of upside. They beat up the Panthers in Week 1, but you can''t put much stock in that. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers would give the Panthers a run for their money.  But in Week 2, the Saints went to Dallas and embarrassed the Cowboys. They scored touchdowns on their first six possessions of the game en route to a 44-19 victory. And five of those six scoring drives went at least 70 yards. Through two games, the Saints have outscored their opponents by 62 points. The offensive personnel isn''t much different than last year, which was no great shakes, so what''s the difference? Their new offensive coordinator is Klint Kubiak, son of Gary Kubiak, head coach of the 2015 Super Bowl winning Denver Broncos and who helped revolutionize NFL rushing attacks. Now how the hell is someone in a Pickem league with a passing interest in football supposed to know that? We''re not. We put our faith in sports websites that are supposed to know that Kubiak combined with Kamara gives you Cartumba! Through two weeks, the Saints offense ranks first in offensive success rate, expected points added per drive, and scoring. They have scored a league-high 11 touchdowns—four more than any other team. The Saints are 2-0, where few expected them to be and Ravens are 0-2 where no one expected them to be.            <br><br>           For all the hoopla of having Derrick Henry in the backfield with Lamarr Jackson, it is understated, and not nearly as well documented defections of coaching staff that has contributed to Baltimore having to climb out of an 0-2 hole. Their defensive coordinator, Mike Macdonald, jumped ship and is now the head coach of Seattle. Their long-time, offensive line coach died of post-surgery complications in August. Like Kubiak coming into New Orleans, changing coordinators, on offence or defence, makes a difference, not always for the best.  The Ravens defence gave up ten points in the fourth quarter at home in losing to Las Vegas and were penalized 11 times for more than a hundred yards.  A lot of that is on the players, but a share has to be given to the coaches, who are calling schemes and.or making adjustments, that often fail to deliver the desired results. The dual rushing threat of Henry and Jackson hasn''t gelled for any number of reasons;  injured or missing offensive linemen, drive-killing penalties and/or a dead coach. The three-game stretch in front of them could define their season; @ Dallas, Buffalo, @ Cincinnati.            <br><br>           Old news, but since 2015. teams that start the season 0-2 have an 11 percent chance of making the playoffs. Projections now have these expected playoffs teams on the out, looking in.           <br><br>           <strong>Baltimore</strong> - Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 78 percent / After starting 0-2 - 41 percent <br>           <strong>Cincinnati</strong> - Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 73 percent / After starting 0-2 - 43 percent <br>           <strong>LA Rams</strong> -  Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 45 percent / After starting 0-2 - 9 percent <br>           <strong>Jacksonville</strong> -  Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 40 percent / After starting 0-2 - 19 percent <br>           <strong>Indianapolis</strong> -  Odds of making the playoffs at the start of the season - 26 percent / After starting 0-2 - 8 percent           <br><br>           I don''t care that Barkley dropped a pass he should have caught, the Eagles loss last night was on Sirianni. The Eagles were up 18-15 with 1:46 left and had third-and-three at the Falcons'' ten.  Atlanta was out of timeouts. This four-down territory. No if and/or buts. Even though Sirianni doesn''t call plays, that message should have been conveyed to offensive coordinator, Kellen Moore.  Few coaches are as aggressive on fourth down as Sirianni, but when the time came for him to fully apply his convictions, he failed. Sirianni has essentially been stripped of almost all of his responsibilities. He doesn’t do the game-planning or play-calling on offense. He doesn’t hire the coordinators. And he doesn’t have autonomy on roster decisions. The one thing he does handle is game management—and he can''t even do that right. They''d run the kush push twice in the game, easily collecting more than a yard and a half each time they ran it. If they ran the ball both times, and remember the play clock is running with Atlanta can''t stop it, even if they don''t convert it, which I find highly unlikely, the Falcons have less than 30 seconds to get from inside their own 10 to the Eagles 35 or 40 with no timeouts. And don''t forget they''d already passed up three when they went for it on fourth down in the first half. If they would have taken the three when they had the chance, they''d be up six and this would be a moot point. They would have taken the field goal and made it a two-score game. I''m not even an Eagles fan and I felt sick about it. Owner Jeffrey Lurie is a forward-thinking guy. Sirianni is on a tight leash. If they don''t make the playoffs, he''s gone. If doesn''t get a win in the playoffs, he''s gone. The Eagles will have to play well from here on in for him to keep his job.            <br><br>           Other quick thoughts:           Kansas City could just as easily be 0-2. They have the best QB/HC matrix in the league and they know how to win.           Carolina has been outscored 83-13 in the first two games of the season. They''re benching Bryce Young. Who cares? They''re in the Daniel Synder conundrum. Unless Tepper does something so outlandish even the NFL can''t live it, the Panthers are stuck with him.           Time to recalibrate our Caleb Williams expectations. He got picked twice and sacked seven times on Sunday night. If the offensive line play doesn''t improve, he might not make it through the year.            The Patriots completed three passes for 18 yards to wide receivers last week.            The Steelers have scored one offensive touchdown in two games and are 2-0.           The Giants scored three touchdowns and Washington scored no touchdowns, yet won the game. That is a first in NFL history.            Matt LaFleur is not a genius. Indianapolis knew Green Bay''s game plan from the first snap and still let them run for 250 yards. Stack the box and force Malik Willis to throw. That''s coaching 101. How Gus Bradley still has a job is one of the mysteries of the NFL.           <br><br>           More than three-quarters of us are out of the Survivor Series after Week 2.            <br><br>           <strong>As I told you back in Week 1, the Wednesday Report and our Pickem league are joining the 21st century.

And then there''s the more extreme version as Ricky Bobby''s father puts it in one of the handful of truly ridiculous, albeit extremely funny, Will Ferrell movies, Talladega Nights, when he says,<strong>"if you''re not first, you''re last"</strong>. While there''s weekly status reports and constant evaluation and reevaluation of Caleb Williams by virtue of his first pick celebrity status, the same attention hadn''t beset the second overall pick, Jayden Daniels. And then last night happened. In his debut performance in front of an international audience, Daniels said "I''ve arrived". He was flawless, going 21-23 for 254 yard and three touchdowns in Washington''s stunning 38-33 win over the winless Bengals. His pinpoint touchdown pass to McLaurin with under three minutes to go to put the Commanders up two scores was a thing of beauty.  I hadn''t seen him play all year and was tuning in more to see if Cincinnati could get off the schneid. I mean, with the exception of Brad, who would forgo watching the Ravens playing the Bills to see the Commanders tangle with the Panthers, who had any expectation of Washington? As I said in my ranking at the beginning of the year, they had a new ownership, new coach and a new quarterback, but the one constant that would remain would be their losing. Well, they''re 2-1 and the win last night wasn''t fluky.  If Daniels brings more of what he delivered last night, Washington may have the franchise quarterback they''ve been seeking since the cut-short glory days of RGIII. I''m not sure I have them pegged to make the playoffs, but Daniels and the Commanders didn''t wither under the bright lights. As a complete aside, Daryl and I will often talk music and reference bands that announced themselves with their first song, making it their calling card, playing brightly and boldly, without explicitly stating  "We''ve arrived". Kind of like Jayden Daniels last night. The most recent for me is Interpol''s. Turn On The Bright Lights. Granted, we''re going back many years, but bang, with the first notes of the first song, I''m in. Great album, There are many other examples. Give us yours.           <br><br>           Getting back to football, the Bengal''s loss punched what could be an irreparable hole in the team’s preseason title hopes. Cincinnati entered 2024 with the sixth-best Super Bowl odds (73 percent). It slipped to 43 percent after last week''s loss. They now face a historically steep climb to make the playoffs. Since 1990, only four teams have made the playoffs after an 0-3 start. While not quite as stark. six playoff teams from last year are 1-2; Ravens, Dolphins, Browns, Cowboys, 49ers, Rams. The forecast for some is not as bleak, as for others. The Dolphins and the Browns have to do serious re-appraisal. In Miami, Tua is gone for at least a couple more weeks, and their back-up, Skylar Thompson, hurt his back on Sunday and is doubtful for next week. Considering how poor he was in losing 23-3 to Seattle, that may not be a bad thing. I don''t know who''s next in line, but it can''t be much worse. Stephen Ross and company should already be looking at next year. With the Browns, it comes back to the serial sexual predator, DeShaun Watson. He''s been bad all year and last week he was particularly pathetic in losing to the hapless Giants at home. The Browns are paying him a king''s ransom, but he''s not getting better. If anything, he''s regressing. Even if Stefanski wanted to bench him, he couldn''t. Jimmy Haslan owns the team and he''s the one who brought Watson to Cleveland and awarded him the completely unprecedented five-year contract of guaranteed money. Until he renages, Watson starts. Dawg pound be damned. He should really do a re-take. Just look at what the Red Rifle did for Carolina? Doesn''t an intransigent owner owe it to its fans to give his team the best chance to win? Not in Jimmy Haslan''s books. So we scratch off Cleveland and Miami.            <br><br>           Next in line in the unenviable job of reviving diminishing playoff hopes would have to be the Rams. They pulled off a four-quarter miracle, but that was as much 49ers screw-ups as anything. Cupp is back on the injured list after two healthy weeks and Nacua is out of service for another 4-6 weeks. It''s a scramble each week to get five linemen to protect Stafford, who''s been great, but he can''t overcome a growing number of injuries and a depleted defence. Dallas is a disaster as well. Dak will lead in the league in passing yards out of necessity. The defence that I thought would take a step-up with Mike Zimmer is in full retreat. The Ravens ran roughshod a week after the Saints put up 41 on the Cowboys in Jerry''s World.  It''s not much they have bad defensive players as they get pushed around; on defence and on offence. They can''t run the ball and they can''t defend the run; a terrible combination for a team with playoff aspirations.. Between Mike McCartthy and Nick Sirianni, who put on another clinic on how not to coach, it''s tough to say who Belichick will coach next. Despite the rash of injuries to big names in San Fran, I expect them to weather the storm. Baltimore could easily be 3-0. All the same, they play the current best team in the league on Sunday and could be 1-3. Josh Allen is a one-man wrecking crew.            <br><br>           Of the two Patriot greats who got behind the mike this year, who would have thought Belichick would be better than Brady. Belichick is an encyclopedia of football knowledge and the informal structure of the various podcasts and the Manningcast he does, suit his style. Doing color commentary for football games, which Brady is doing for far more money than he ever made during his playing days, is often about dispensing short, pithy eight to ten seconds nuggets of insight and/or analysis. It''s not standing at a podium post-game delivering gracious, well-mannered minute long post-mortems on a drive or a game. Like Belichick, Brady has a lot to say. Unfortunately, his medium doesn''t afford him the time to say it. He''ll get better, but he''s no Greg Olsen or Tony Romo.             <br><br>           So, am I the only one who noticed, or the only one who bothered to mention it, but how does the owner of a team induct himself into the team''s Ring of Honour? Arthur Blank owns the Falcons. As far as the Atlanta Falcons are concerned, he can do anything he wants. But is it really necessary, or just a trite egotistical, to have a halftime ceremony inducting yourself into your team''s Ring of Honour? Like someone on the induction committee is going to say no. You own the bloody team. I guess if you can''t win a Super Bowl Ring, you have to ring your own bell. As per usual, the Chiefs won a game they could have easily lost. How that pass in the end zone in the final minute wasn''t pass interference is beyond me. However, it''s no time to be pounding the panic button in KC. Still, this is hardly the high-flying Chiefs of years past. It''s a punchless passing game. Mahones needed 40 attempted passes to reach 220 yards against a bad Falcons defense.  His average depth of throw has decreased every year since 2018, when he took over as the Chiefs starter. No longer go balls and deep crosses to Tyreek Hill and Sammy Watkins. They''re now manufacturing first downs with drag routes and quick-in patterns. They''re a victim of the two-high coverage they forced defences to use against them.            <br><br>           There''s a lot more I could say, but it is unseasonably warm in the Peg. Mid-twenties and supposed to stay this way through the weekend so I''m cutting this short.            <br><br>           Okay, time to enter the brave new world. The schedule, where you''ll make your picks, is on the website. The standings are on the website. The Survivor series isn''t yet posted on the website, but there''s only two left after Week 3; Makaila and Allan.. $340 big ones to the winner, You can still make your pick Thursday and the rest Sunday. Nothing has really changed. An automated feature will send out people''s picks on a thread, similar to the thread we created with the Wednesday Report.            <br><br>           A big thanks to Roudy, who did a lot of the heavy-lifting,  We''ll add to it as time goes along. There''s a comment board so let''s continue the banter. If you have any questions, drop me a note.

I thought anyone who replaced Skylar Thompson would be a step-up. I misspoke. Tyler Huntley was abysmal. He''d been an adequate back-up to LaMarr in Baltimore for years, but on Monday, he looked lost. I''d put a fair share of blame on Mike McDaniels, who didn''t properly prepare Huntley or his team. It''s inexcusable for a home team to play that poorly on national television, back-up quarterback or not. One of Al Davis''s great lines is. "We''re an injury away from being good". The best thing that happened to Tennessee last night was Will Levins getting hurt. Mason Rudolph gives the Titans a much better chance to win than Levins. Brian Callahan should know this. He was a better quarterback than Pickens in Pittsburgh last year and when he had an opportunity to play, he showed it. Time to earn your head coach stripes, Brian. Sit Levins and start Rudolph.           <br><br>           Ben Johnson turned down a number of head coaching jobs to remain the offensive coordinator in Detroit. It was a good decision. He''ll have an opportunity to be a head coach, but he may never have a better chance to get a Super Bowl ring than he has with Detroit. It''s hard to play offense any better than Detroit did on Monday night. Goff was 18 for 18. The running backs were getting five a crack. Everything was working so well they had Goff catching passes. Seattle gained more than 500 yards so the defence has some work to do. Dan Campbell gives me cause for concern, but looking around the NFC, it''s hard to find a more trustworthy team.            <br><br>                         Is it too early to believe that Minnesota could be a contender? Don''t let the final score delude you. That cheese-kicking in Green Bay was over in the first half. If the Viking punt returner didn''t lose the ball in the sun, Green Bay would have never gotten as close as they did. The Vikings are really well-coached and they have a lot of things you''re looking for; an above-average offensive line, a pair of quality wide receivers, including the best in the league, and a relentless, exotic and unconventional defence. I have to convince myself that this isn''t the Kirk Cousins Vikings where every game came down to the final minute and winning by two scores was a pipe dream. The Sam Darnold Vikings are winning games convincingly. And playoff teams at that - San Francisco, Houston and Green Bay are not your garden variety cellar dwellers. The only team that didn''t like Sam Darnold was the team that drafted him; the NY Jets. Both Carolina and San Francisco were very positive about Darnold. Carolina traded him to make room for Bryce Young (he was the first overall choice, remember) and he wasn''t going to see the field in San Francisco with the Niners committed to Brock Purdy. This isn''t the first time a well-travelled quarterback found a second home. Geno Smith and Baker Mayfield made several stops before finding a location and organization they could flourish in. For me, the game of the weekend is NY Jets against Minnesota, in the first of two London games this year. Don''t forget this game starts at 8:30 (CST). I want to see if Rodgers can make the blitz-happy Vikings pay for an under-manned backend.            <br><br>                         The marquee match-up of the past week was a lop-sided blowout with the outcome being so assured both teams went to their back-up quarterbacks in the third quarter. The Bills hadn''t lost by double-digits since sometime in the ''22 season and I didn''t think it would happen even when they were down 21-3 because the Ravens are notorious for giving up leads. Wouldn''t you know, their defence showed up for the first time this year. They may have been present at previous games in the corporeal sense, but they were really just going through the motions. They consistently harangued Allen and actually just looked bigger and stronger than the Bills; on both sides of the ball. The Bills defence is missing a couple core players and may have looked good the past couple games when they''re carrying big leads. But when you''re down three scores and you have to stop Henry and stop Jackson and stop Hill, they couldn''t seem to match the size or the speed of Baltimore. We''re just now getting an idea of how potent the Henry Jackson Hill attack could be. Henry Jackson Hill sounds like a very white law firm; the kind that has no moral scruples and would have no compunction about defending a reprobate like P Diddy, but I''m going astray. You can''t call Henry fast because Tyreek Hill is fast, but he''s almost like a train that gets momentum and that momentum gives him another gear. He''s in his 30''s, taken over 2500 carries and yet can still outrun younger, and what you would think would be more fleet of foot Buffalo defenders. To say nothing for trying to tackle him. It''s one thing when It''s the first month of the season. Think January, it''s -10 and you''ve got his locomotive running at you.            <br><br>                         Bo Nix throws for 60 yards and the Broncos won. I thought that was impossible unless your name was Eli Manning. I''ll bet the Giants won a handful of games 14-6 where the defence / specials teams produced all their scoring. Eli''s passing line would be something like 11 for 27 for 58 yards and a pair of picks. And they''d win! Minus his two Super Bowls, wins that would rank on par with the United States Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Olympics for unlikelihood, he wouldn''t even be considered for the Hall of Fame. Completion percentage, touchdown / interception ratio, team winning percentage, leadership, general like-ability; he''d rank in the lower echelon of all those categories. Backpfeifengesicht: he''s at the top of the ist. And they''re going to send this guy to Canton.            <br><br>                         Kansas City is like Houdini. They escaped again, but you''re not quite sure how they did it. They''ve won four games this year with regressing totals each week - 27, 24, 22 and 17. That''s not a good trajectory. In fact, they won their last 10 games going back to last year with a point differential of 61 points.  Christ, Miami beat Denver by 61 points one game a couple of years back. They''re squeaking out wins left, right and center, often by the grace of timely turnovers, bad officiating, or opposing team screw-ups.And I don''t say this to take anything away from them. They know how to win. They recognize what they have to do to win. It''s a learned skill that some teams, especially coaches / general managers never learn. The Chiefs will probably end the year 14-3 with a +45 point differential, but they have Mahones and they have Reid, which gives them as good a chance as anyone when the margin of victory is so small. And their winning margin continues to get smaller and smaller with accumulating injuries. Their leading receiver, Rashee Rice, is gone for the rest of the year. Their off-season wide receiver acquisition to help stretch the field, Hollywood Brown, hasn''t dressed this year and isn''t expected to suit up from here on in. Worthy is Tyreek Hill fast, but he''s also a rookie, without the college credentials of someone like Malik Nabors. Him, Juju Schuster and an over-the-hill Travis Kelce is all that''s left. Oh, and their lead back, Isiah Pacheco is on the sidelines for at least another four weeks. They''ll explore the free agent market, but one would assume that''s slim pickings. The trade deadline is something like three weeks away, but you''d have to think teams would be wary of sending their gifted, but disgruntled receiver (DeVante Adams) to help feed the Chiefs glory. I won''t call it a dynasty yet. That comes with another Super Bowl.            <br><br>                         Plenty more to talk about that I''m not going to get to. Washington is the favourite to win the NFC East. After the pummelling in Tampa Bay, Sirianno''s leash is even tighter.  Flacco comes off the bench and outperforms the starter in different cities in consecutive years.             <br><br>                         If the Giants weren''t such an unmitigated failure that nobody wants to be aligned with, the head coach of the Giants, Brian Daboll, would be doing commercials for Ozempic or some other misappropriated weight-loss drug. I hardly recognized him on the sidelines last Thursday. With a hat covering his bald pate and 50 pounds lighter than what he tilted the scales at last season, he looked like a new person;  it''s not doing anything for the team, but he looks healthier.           <br><br>                         That''s it. I''ll admit I''m finding the new system strange, as I''m sure you are. The first week was going to be some headaches, which I think we''ve rectified. Hang in there. Only two dbs this week. If something''s wrong, let me know. We''ll try to fix it.             <br><br>           Regards,           <br><br>           <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>           <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

There are a number of new features on the website:                <ul style="list-style: disc; line-height: 1.5; padding: 0 30px;">                 <li>New <strong>Comment Boxes</strong> on home and leaderboard pages.</li>                 <li><strong>Picks</strong> are tracked by your name, correct spelling required, so when you have more than one visit to enter picks, previous picks will be greyed out and disabled. <strong>Send Feedback</strong> if you have any issues with selections not disabling on subsequent visits or anything else. </li>                 <li><strong>DBs</strong> are sync''d with Game selections and vice versa.</li>                 <li><strong>Leaderboard</strong> now has "Prev Week" scores and "This Week" points added to the existing columns.</li>                 <li><strong>Game Selections</strong> can be deselected if you chose a game and want to come back to it later, up to kick-off.</li>                 <li><strong>Survivor</strong> page is updated and finito - <strong>Allan won!</strong></li>               </ul>                <p>Since Roudy doesn''t have a proper sandbox for testing, he has to submit the form at different times to see if the code is working. Our apologies for the intermittent and unsolicited emails. I expect that will be drawing to a close within the next week or two, unless of course, we receive a flurry of requests for new features, at which point, Roudy and I will discuss and determine how to proceed. Easy for me to say. Roudy will tell me when he''s had enough.                <br><br>               I promise I''ll have something for you next week, which you can enjoy, ridicule or downright ignore.</p>                <br><br>               Regards,               <br><br>               <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>               <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');

What a bunch of frauds. From their octogenarian owner who makes as little sense as Donald Trump, to the coach no one believes in, including his players, to the defensive coordinator who can''t figure out why the schemes he drew up in the 80''s are no longer working; if this is America''s team, the United States is more deeply troubled and problem-ridden than I thought, without  even introducing the stark choice its voters will have to make on November 5. It will take the Cowgirls more than a bye week to expel the squalid remnants of yet another humiliating home loss.  Going back to January’s wild-card playoff game, that’s <strong>four straight home losses</strong> for the Cowboys, in which they were outscored 110-35 in the first half alone. It’s not just that they’re losing, but how thoroughly they’re getting obliterated. Although the Lions are a good, not quite great team, the Cowboys should never look like they don’t belong on the same field as an opponent, especially when playing on their own field. Sunday was the second time in this early season an opponent moseyed into AT&T Stadium and nearly hit 50 points. The Saints scored six touchdowns in Week 2, and the Lions lumped them up even worse. The loss was so lopsided the Lions took to trying various trick plays because scoring the conventional route didn''t offer enough resistance. There''s more than enough blame to go around. JJ is not only the owner, he''s also the non-designated / de facto general manager. He knew they didn''t have a running game. He let Pollard walk, but did nothing to address it. Would Derrick Henry not look good in the silver and blue? He was available. Jerry claims he couldn''t afford it. $14 million is chump change when you''re paying your star wide receiver $35 million and your quarterback in excess of $50 million. Hell, they''re paying Cooks nine or ten mill for catching a pass a week. That''s just one of a series of positions they need reinforcement. At the same time, it''s difficult for Mike McCarthy to scapegoat defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer when the offence he''s calling plays for is so putrid. There are only two teams in the NFC with a worse scoring differential, Carolina and the LA Rams. All in all, it''s a clusterfuck.               <br><br>                As for the Lions, that''s about as bad as you can feel after a signature win. Their defensive stud, <strong>Adrian Hutchinson broke his leg</strong> and is gone for the year. Statistically, Hutchinson is elite and he''s the central cog in the Lions defence. Big high motor pass rusher in the mould of John Randle. Different physique, but relentless. He''s got 7.5 sacks. No one else on the team has more than 2.5. This is a mediocre defence with Hutchinson playing. Without him, there could be a serious drop-off.  The litmus test comes early with the Lions visiting the Vikings next week.                <br><br>               So <strong>TB (Tom Brady)</strong> is doing the Detroit / Dallas game and he''s getting better after six weeks on the job. He''s giving you a little more about what he''s seeing and what he''s thinking. Anyway, yesterday, he was raving about the Lions offence and he said, "I''d love to be in charge of an offence like that". <strong>I tell you, he still wants to play.</strong> If the Chiefs, LIons or 49erers lost their starter, I''d bet he''d be on the first plane out to any one of those destinations. In the back of his mind, he''s kinda hoping one of them does get hurt. He said it in a way he hasn''t completely given up hope of playing football again. It says to me, he wants to play a hell of a lot more than he wants to broadcast. Mind you, that would further complicate his ambitions of owning a chunk of the Raiders. Can you imagine TB owning a NFL team? You currently have lots of owners who know a lot more about making money than owning a professional football organization. With Brady, you''d get football acumen and a built in winning culture.               <br><br>               Speaking of culture or lack thereof, the Jags lost again in their home away from home and looked brutal in doing so. <strong>Do you know what Trevor Lawrence''s record is the last 11 games? 1-10.</strong> Just a couple years back, he was the can''t fail, future Hall-of-Famer.  This past off-season, they gave him a huge contract extension more on the promise of what he can be more than what he''s actually done.  And then I come across this little morsel. He''s 21-35 (56 games) for his career.  Here''s the list of quarterbacks who''ve played at least 55 games and won less than 25 games. Trevor Lawrence, Tim Couch, David Carr,  Josh McCown, Rick Meier, Daniel Jones, Blake Bortles, Charlie Batch and Josh Freeman. That, my friends, is an inauspicious list, something you don''t want anything to do with. Meanwhile, from the couch to the podium goes Joe Flacco, another win standing in for the starter and tossing a pair of touchdown passes along the way, the eighth straight game he''s done so. If I''d known he was going to start when I made my picks, I would have taken Indianapolis. And the team they beat, Tennessee, didn''t take my advice and stick with Mason Rudolph. They went back to Will Levins who completed 24 passes for a grand total of 95 yards. Brian Callahan is trying his best to make sure he never gets a head coaching job again after getting fired from the Titans, which will happen, probably at the end of the season.                <br><br>               The Jets weren''t prepared to give Robert Salah that long. He''s gone after five. Too much backroom intrigue to know who spoke to who at what time and what was said. Woody Johnson, who owns the team, says it was his decision and his decision alone. Oh, and by the way, he spoke to Aaron Rodgers the night before, but they didn''t talk about Saleh. Right. Rodgers would sell his mother to the lowest bidder to get his way. Considering he doesn''t talk to his family, I don''t think that''s a stretch. He threw wide receiver Mike Williams under the bus for his route-running in his post-game comments after the Jets third straight loss, his first with the new coach and offensive coordinator. Funny how he failed to mention he had the ball in the final minutes of each of those one-score losses and failed to deliver each time. He''s a certified conspiracy theorist and likes to tell everyone he''s the smartest person in the room, just not that explicitly. I''m not fond of the man. But you have to hand it to the Jets for their all-in mentality. On Tuesday, they upped the stakes and brought in Rodgers long-time Green Bay teammate, DeVante Adams from the Raiders. Adams is a coveted receiver and there was a lot of speculation of teams vying for his services. On paper, it''s a great move and gives the Jets offence a whole new dimension. Spread the receivers five wide with Adams and Wilson meriting double coverage and who''s going to stop the run?  Bring people into the box and get burned downfield. Pick your poison. In football, there''s few things as dangerous as an offence that can pass and run. Not wanting to leave empty-handed after Adams jumped to the Jets, the Bills got Amari Cooper from the Browns. Not as high profile, but a good addition to a team very thin at receiver. The NFL season is starting to get very interesting.                <br><br>               And then there''s <strong>Lamar Jackson</strong>. He''s <strong>eighth in the league in rushing and he''s a quarterback</strong>. Hard to believe he''s a two-time MVP and this might be the best football he''s ever played. It seems I say that every year. Each year, he''s in a different situation with different players and it provides him just another opportunity to unveil abilities we didn''t know he had. Think back 18 months. He''s in a contract stand-off with Baltimore and no one, not one single team was willing to take a chance on him and give him the fully-guaranteed money he was seeking, something comparable to the DeShaun Watson contract.                <br><br>               Speaking of, there was a caption during the Philadelphia - Cleveland game that said the <strong>Browns were 0-26 in third-down conversions</strong> in recent games. That seems impossible. 0-26 on third and 10 I could buy, but even that seems improbable. There could be defensive holding or pass interference, roughing the passer. Hell, they could possibly complete a pass. Nonetheless, they''re sticking with Watson because Jimmy Haslan says so. The best thing that could happen is DeShaun gets hurt. You''re still playing him, but Jameis Winston would at least give the team a chance to win.                <br><br>               Are we sleeping on the <strong>Tampa Bay Bucs</strong>? They <strong>put up 51 points and almost 600 yards of offence</strong> on Sunday. Granted, they were playing a Saints team that has lost four on the trot and has been completely rudderless after winning their first two. Baker is still wildly inconsistent. The highs are sky-high, where he looks like a top ten quarterback, but the lows are DeShaun Watson-like. He had three interceptions in the second quarter so you can never be sure what Baker you''re going to get, quarter to quarter, game to game. They''ve found a running game to complement a potent passing threat with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.                <br><br>               There''s a lot more to say, but hopefully I''ve given you something to chew on. <strong>Another early Sunday morning from London</strong>. It''s a stinker with New England at Jacksonville so I wouldn''t encourage you to watch it, just not to forget to submit your pick on time.                <br><br>               <strong>The Disruptor Point Spread Game of the Week</strong> is a Super Bowl rematch; <strong>Kansas City at San Francisco</strong>. With the spread not likely factoring into it, picking the winner is a two-point game.                <br><br>               Saint Roudy continues to add new features to the website. Love to get some feedback. I hate you 🤬. You''re an asshole 💩.

This is all I have time for.               <br><br>               The early slate of games on Sunday was magnificent.. Six of the eight games were decided by five points or less and four of those games had game-winning scores in the last minute. I don''t watch "The Red Zone". I''m more of a football purist, but Scott Hansen must have been going wild in the Witching Hour. Going quadbox while doing lines of coke under the table. To be as animated and high-adrenaline as Scott requires more than what a steady flow of espresso can deliver.               <br><br>               <strong>Biggest losers of the Week:</strong>               <br><br>               <strong>[a] Chicago Bears - </strong>They were eight seconds away from winning a game they had no right winning. The other team has no timeouts and the ball at their own 30.               <br><br>                Rule one: Protect the sideline. Anything in-bounds and the game is over. Washington had to get the ball to midlield to even attempt a Hail Mary and the Bears give them an uncontested 18 yard out to stop the clock. How does that happen? What is the coach thinking? And if that wasn''t bad enough, the next play was worse. You''ve seen it a hundred times and doesn''t need further explanation. It''s hard to win games in the NFL. Don''t beat yourselfs. Handing balls to an offensive lineman at the 1-yard line? That''s the best call in your playbook to punch it from the 1? How did that even get into the playbook? Had they even practiced the play? It certainly didn''t look like it. This was coaching malfeasance.               <br><br>                <em>Players win games. Coaches lose them.</em> - <strong>Bill Belichick</strong>               <br><br>               <strong>[b] New York Jets - </strong>Through eight games, the Jets have scored two more points with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback than they did last year with Zach Wilson at quarterback. They''ve lost three straight after firing Saleh and have given up 62 points in the last two games to a pair of the worst offenses in the league. They let the Patriots back-up Jacoby Brissett, who can''t run and has trouble throwing a ball more than 15 yards downfield, drive the field in the final three minutes. The Jets defence, which was the only thing half-decent with Saleh in charge, has gotten worse. DeVante Adams has done nothing since he arrived when it''s offensive linemen they should have been acquiring. Greg "the leg" Zuerlein has probably cost them a couple games and missed another field goal and an extra point on Sunday. They''re 2-6 and the Aaron Rodgers gamble has proven a colossal failure. I don''t think he''s coming back and if he does, they''ll miss the playoffs again. They''re not just a badly run team. They''re a badly run organization.               <br><br>               <strong>[c] Tennessee Titans -</strong> Some say the NFL acronym stands for "Not For Long", which could be used to apply to Brian Callahan''s coaching career. You can''t attribute all player mistakes to bad coaching, but when you give up a 90-yard kickoff return, a 70-yard punt return, a 64 yard punt return called back for a block in the back, a further 44 yard punt return, plus another four turnovers, it is a reflection of how you run your team. Is it any wonder they lost 52-14? Dan Campbell probably called off the dogs or it could have gotten uglier. At halftime, the Lions had nine passing yards and 35 points. The Titans weren''t just bad this week. They are consistently bad every week. I can''t imagine them winning another game unless Carolina comes calling. Just as I say that I see the Titans play the Patriots at home this weekend. That''s not to be missed.               <br><br>               <strong>[d] Indianapolis Colts -</strong> Anthony Richardson stat line against Houston - 10 for 32 for 170 yards and five sacks, he has a 44 percent completion record, the worst in the NFL this year.  Since 2000, there have been 826 quarterbacks. AR is 823rd of quarterbacks in pass completion percentage of those who threw at least 100 passes. He''s wildly inaccurate and is constantly throwing into tight windows. Whether it be bad decision-making or a lack of experience, he''s not ready to be an NFL quarterback. Back-up Flacco should start. He has started in two games replacing an injured Richardson and threw 7 touchdown passes and one interception. Richardson has started six games  and has thrown 4 touchdown passes and has thrown 7 interceptions. Head coach Shane Steichen has repeatedly said, "Anthony Richardson gives our team the best chance to win". The fact is, he doesn''t. He cost them the game on Sunday and several other winnable games earlier in the season. I understand he''s a fifth overall pick, and you want to hand him the reins, but not if he''s driving the team into a ditch.               <br><br>               <strong>[e] Baltimore Ravens</strong> - How many fourth quarter leads can a good team give up before you question their ability to close the deal, They are last in the league in defending passes inside the numbers and are second-highest in allowing explosive plays off those throws. You can''t win championships with those numbers, The Browns moved the ball with ease considering they started their back-up, Jameis Winston, and traded away their best receiver last week, The Ravens are now 5-3, with losses to a pair of 2-6 teams, and have surrendered home field advantage in the playoffs considering the Chiefs are 7-0. The Ravens are a Super Bowl calibre team, but they have to clean up their back end to avoid another year of playoff failure.               <br><br>               Questions, comments, and complaints are welcome.                <br><br>               Regards,               <br><br>               <strong>John Wyndels</strong><br>               <strong>Commissioner, NFL Pickem</strong>         </p>                </div>     </div>   </div>   </div>  </body> </html>');
