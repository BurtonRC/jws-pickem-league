The more things change, the more they stay the same. Is that a truism or an adage or an aphorism? I always get those words mixed up. Maybe it’s all of them, or none of them, and simply a phrase. Regardless, it’s an apt statement when referring to the NFL.&nbsp; The beginning of a new season brings new coaches, new rules and old faces in new places. At the same time, there are the constants: the Browns losing, often in painful fashion, the Giants ghastly offence, and the Bills and the Ravens showing they are the truly the greatest show on turf. Let’s start with the last one.</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-size:large;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Fortis Fortune Adiuvat</span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-size:large;color:rgb(0,0,0)">For John Wick and Donald Trump, those are words to live by. Trump is more the Fortune Favours the Merciless and the Repugnant that Cheat and Lie to Get Their Way, but I digress. John Harbaugh favours being bold. The Ravens go for it on fourth down as much as any team in the NFL, and with LaMar Jackson your quarterback its hard to argue that logic. So why does he turn craven when courageous is the call late in the game? Why did he take the ball out of Jackson's hands and give it back to the Bills when you're up by two and there's 93 seconds left on the clock? Why did he run three so inanely unimaginative plays leading up to the final punt? It's a replay of last year when the Ravens repeatedly squandered fourth-quarter leads that had them playing in Buffalo in the playoffs, instead of back home in Baltimore.</span><br></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">It’s a stretch to say Harbaugh cost his team the game and possible home-field advantage through the AFC playoffs when it's the first game of a 17-game season and Derrick Henry's fumble with just over three minutes left was the the biggest needle-mover in the Bills comeback. But how do you blame the guy who finished the day with 170 yards, averaging almost 10 yards a plug, and two touchdowns? He was shedding the Bills and the Ravens were moving the ball at will. They flashed some ridiculous stat in third quarter, and don't shoot me if I get the numbers wrong because you probably saw it as well. Halfway through the third quarter, the Ravens had 18 plays of more than 10 yards and 10 over 20 yards. In the third quarter? in the first game of the year? Against their leading foe in the AFC while on the road? I don't know if the Giants will amass those numbers in the entire year. The Bills were very fortunate to win the game, and if they don't clean up their defence by the next time they meet, they won't be in a position to manufacture a miracle like they did on Sunday night.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">That was written Monday morning. It is now Tuesday evening and I’m writing the remainder of what will be very short Wednesday Report with my mobile phone from the cottage. Don’t ask me why I don’t have a laptop. I don’t have a satisfactory response. There’s a reason texts are only a sentence or two. So let’s cut to the chase. Let’s test the panic meter in Week 1 because that’s what we do after the first week of the new season.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Miami - I called them soft in the rankings last week and after getting demolished against Indianapolis on Sunday, I would say I was right on the mark. They got out gained in the first half 270 to 45. The Colts has seven drives and scored on every one of them, not that annyone was confusing the Colts offence for the Ravens.&nbsp; And then there’s the coach. They talk to Miami head coach, Mike McDaniels after the game and he sounds more docile than the players. Show a little pride. Some gumption. A sign you’re in it to win it. Mike McDaniels will never be mistaken for Dan Campbell. It’s going to be a long year for the Fins. On a 1 to 10 scale, I’m giving Tua and company a solid 8.5 in the panic meter.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Kansas City’s AFC West Dominance - They’re in last place in their division for the first time at any time in a season since 2002. I don’t know if that’s true but it’s feels that way. Las Vegas is better, the Chargers were awesome in Brazil and Denver turned the ball over four times and still won by eight. The Chiefs will have competition to not only win the division, but to make the playoffs. Worthy runs into his own player, separates his shoulder and won’t be back for weeks. Rasheed Rice is suspended for the first six weeks and Kelce is several years past his prime. They can’t run the ball and Mahones is great, but he isn’t a miracle worker. There was a lot of discussion in the off-season of Mahones needing to revert to his early KC days and push the ball down the field. To who? Their speed merchants are sitting on the sidelines. Don’t look now, but Philadelphia is coming to town and KC is an underdog at home, looking hard at falling 0-2. 6.5 and not a half-point lower.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Carolina - You can put Bryce Young in the Ryan Leaf and JaMarcus Russell camp: first overall picks who can’t quarterback an NFL team. He threw two picks, had a fumble and a pick-six saved by a penalty. This is season 1 and 2 all over again. 9. If they’re not the worst team in the league, they’re damn close.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Detroit - You lose both your coordinators, a couple interior lineman from what was a stellar offensive line, and your starters haven’t played a meaningful down since last year. Of course you’re going to suck. The game wasn’t as close as the score indicates. It was over a long time before tithe clock hit 0. The offensive line was particularly sketchy, with newly-minted Micah Parsons in gold and green giving All-Pro, Penei Sewell more than he could handle. Gibbs totalled just 50 yards.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">You might not ever see that again. No panic for the Lions just yet. I’ll give it a 3.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);border-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(255,255,255)"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Chicago - I was talking on the phone on Monday night with Cousin Matt and we’re both coming down hard on the Vikings in the first half.&nbsp; Caleb Williams starts 10 for 10, McCarthy looks lost in his first NFL start and it’s shaping up to be a forgettable year for the purple and gold. I turn the game off wondering why the hell would I put my faith behind a team likely to finish last in their division when lo and &nbsp;behold, I turn it back on in the fourth quarter and McCarthy is looking like Dan Fouts, while Caleb Williams is looking like the quarterback making his professional debut. I think the Bears had five false start penalties, more than 100 yards of penalties and a blatant ignorance of the new kick-off rules. There will be a lot of growing pains for the Ben Johnson and the Bears again this year in a city anxious to bring a championship back 40 yard after their last. On the panic scale, nothing less than a 7.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir="auto" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);border-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(255,255,255)"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></font></div><div dir="auto" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);border-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(255,255,255)"><font size="4" style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Nothing more.
