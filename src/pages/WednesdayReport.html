Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
 The first third of the season is in the books. and if I'm struck with anything it's the parity within the league. There's not a great team amongst the lot. Chances are, if there's 16 games that week, more than half will end in one-score games. Anybody can be anybody, ergo: Any Given Sunday. 
<br></br>
You can talk yourself into a number of good teams, teams that are leading their division and near the top of their conferences, but are nonetheless flawed, I'm not going to bother with 24 teams that fit anywhere between abject failures (Tennessee, Miami, NY Jets) to the lurkers (Washington, Indianapolis Seattle, Denver). I think there are eight teams that can potentially win the Super Bowl. Even within those eight teams there may be a pecking order, but I'm not inclined to steer the discussion in that direction. There's no big surprise to see a lot of the teams listed as my eight Super Bowl contenders. A number of the teams have had that tag for four or five years running. But there are a couple surprises. Without further adieu, here's the top eight in no particular order.
<br></br>
<strong>Kansas City</strong> - Only one name matters: Patrick Mahones. He can do whatever the offence needs. whether it's working within structure, extending plays, scrambling for extra yards, or throwing the ball downfield. He does it all and better than anyone else, Josh Allen and LaMarr Jackson included. He doesn't possess the physical assets of either of them, but his ability to improvise and bring a calm to the frenzy is unmatched by his contemporaries. After the 0-2 start and the chatter of their ultimate demise, they're back to 3-3 and playing with an efficiency unseen since the Tyreek Hill days. They get their leading receiver, Rasheed Rice, back after serving his six game suspension and the outlook is good. If they can get Chris Jones on message, like he was on Sunday night, after being called out by teammates in prior weeks for his on/off attitude and downright quitting on plays, all will be well.
<br></br> 
<strong>Detroit</strong> - I don't look at this team any differently after their loss to the Chiefs. Their offence is potent and can play with the best of them. The problems are on the other side of the ball. It's one thing to have injuries and another to have season-ending injuries. The secondary is decimated by injuries, but all of them are expected back, unlike teams like the Niners, who have lost two defensive players, who are amongst the best at their position in the league. Those players can't be replaced and will circumvent any Lombardi-esque dreams. I still think Dan Campbell takes more risks than he has to, but when the back half is leaky, as it is right now, the risks may be warranted. But maybe check the rulebook before you draw up pretty plays that are undone by flags.
<br></br>
<strong>Buffalo</strong> - Buffalo's defence has struggled in one phase or another since 2020, but the 2025 unit is their biggest obstacle to a Super Bowl win. The Falcons flew up and down the field on Monday, finding explosive plays far too often for a team with championship aspirations. The corners can't cover. The linebackers have multiple injuries and safeties can't make open-field tackles. Is Matt Milano still on the Bills roster? After Monday’s loss to the Falcons (3-2), the Bills are 0-2 against teams with winning records through Week 6 (they lost to the Patriots last week). The four teams the Bills have defeated — the Ravens, Jets, Dolphins and Saints — have a combined record of 3-21. Josh Allen still has turnover issues, but that's the least of their concerns. They've played uninspired football for the past two weeks and have fallen out of first place in their division for the first time since Tom Brady left the AFC East and took his services to Tampa.
<br></br>
<strong>Green Bay</strong> - I'd like the Packers not to make a mess out of what should be an easy win for once. In their last three games they struggled to beat a toothless Bengals team, tied a defenceless Cowboys team, and squandered a victory over the Browns, hardly a triumvirate of world-beaters. The Micah Parsons trade was going to be the missing ingredient to transform a good team to a great team. That hasn't happened. No one is comparing the 2025 Packers defense to the 1985 Bears. Their biggest problem is Jordan Love, who's as likely to uncork a beautiful 45-yard completion as he is to throw into double-coverage. The potential is there. Six weeks in, they're a ways from fulfilling it.
<br></br>
<strong>Tampa Bay</strong> - Baker Mayfield has led four last-minute comebacks in the first five games. He's one of the front-runners for MVP consideration, for all that's worth six games in. It's easy to forget how much ground he's covered in his nine-year career and the ups and downs of the former number one pick in the draft. He was one of my favourite punching-bags while in Cleveland. He got picked up by the Rams as a reclamation project, passed on to Carolina where his playing days seemed genuinely numbered, prior to backing up Brady and assuming the starting job in Tampa. A good portion of his on-field heroics this year have been behind a makeshift offensive line and missing his top receivers, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. He's on his third offensive coordinator in four years in Tampa, with Dave Canales and Liam Cohen taking head coaching jobs elsewhere. Tampa's early success is largely Baker's will to win and his unshakeable confidence in those around him, even if they are a step down on the depth chart. They're 5-1 and I don't think we've seen their best.
<br></br>
<strong>LA Rams</strong> - The Rams didn't have the prettiest win in Baltimore, but they're 4-2 and their two losses have been a last-second field-goal block to the Eagles and an overtime loss to the Niners. You can trust the offensive infrastructure with McVay and Stafford. And depending on if, and how much, time Nacua misses with his injury on Sunday, he's probably going to be the leading receiver at year's end. Considering the turnover of personnel the last three or four years since they won the Super Bowl, it's incredible they've remained so consistently good. Aaron Donald, Cooper Kupp, Jalen Ramsey; all All-Pro's, either retired or playing elsewhere. It's a huge credit to GM Les Snead in keeping the team together.
<br></br> 
<strong>Philadelphia</strong> - They're the defending Super Bowl champion, but it hasn't been pretty. Only the Chiefs have more experience and a greater winning pedigree. But they've had two losses in a row, the offence is struggling, AJ Brown is unhappy, and there's a chance this turns ugly. That being said, they have a lot of talent. Vic Fangio is still the defensive coordinator and Howie Roseman is still the GM.  The trading deadline is less than a month away and there's been a lot of discussion of this being one of the more active in years. If there's a play to be made to bring in someone to help the team down the stretch and in the postseason, it's Howie Roseman. If you remember last year, the Eagles were labouring late in the season, only to rebound and win it all. Not saying it's going to happen again, but they'll have their say.
<br></br>
<strong>New England</strong> - I am a rabid and unapologetic Patriots fan. I've been very judicious in singing their praises this year, but the time has come.  Their schedule has been so soft that it's difficult what to make their 4-2 record. They face the easiest schedule in the league coming home, so they will be going back to where they rightfully belong, the playoffs. If there's a dark horse for MVP to believe in, it's Drake Maye. After referring to him as Dake Maybe a couple weeks back for his incredible play interspersed with bouts of stupidity, for the last three weeks he's been cooking defences with his passing from the pocket and his scrambling. Say what you like of Josh McDaniel as a head coach, he's proven to be a very effective offensive coordinator in New England. Granted, he had Tom Brady to work with all those years, but don't forget Mac Jones was a Pro Bowler for the one year he worked with McDaniels as a coordinator in New England. If you don't follow the Patriots, you don't realize the importance of Christian Gonzales. Their first-round draft pick from last year missed the first four games of this year. He's a shut-down corner who provides the backend with a diversity it lacked in his absence. After a twenty year dynasty and picking up six Super Bowls along the way, perhaps it was fate that New England came crashing back to earth. Well, those threadbare years have passed and the Pats are at the beginning of a long run of playoff football prominence. 
<br></br>
Call me crazy for listing the Patriots as a contender for the Super Bowl. They beat Buffalo in Buffalo, and with the exception of KC, I don't see a whole lot of can't miss Super Bowl contenders in the AFC. Denver is the closest. People may take offence with this selection, to which I say, what part of biased and highly opinionated don't you understand?
<br></br>
Have your say. Don't be a stick in the mud and give us your two cents in the comments section.

I was going to spend a portion of today's report talking about how dysfunctional teams do dysfunctional things, but I've said too much already. I've stopped looking at the scoreboard and I'm out of the Survivor Series because of the goddamn bloody Cardinals. Remind me again, why do I do this?
