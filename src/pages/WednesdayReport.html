Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
 I was really struggling for something to write about this week. Not that I've worked that hard to find something. The usual suspects have been covered. The Jets are bad. The Chiefs are still good. <strong>New England can potentially win the Super Bowl</strong> . Done, done, and done. How about Jacksonville? You never write about them? They're 4-3 and shown glimpses of returning to the postseason. Not a chance. With the exception of the Arisoza Cardinals, I can't think of a team I dislike more than Jacksonville. (I've claimed to dislike Philadelphia and Kansas City, but that's more a begrudging respect rather than an unequivocal loathing, which I harbour for the Jaguars) From the uniforms to the stadium to Trevor Lawrence's haircut, it's just a bad look. And sorry, but after six years, Trevor Lawrence will never develop into the can't-miss quarterback he was touted as coming out of college. Jaguars, Panthers, Bengals. What a bunch of pussies. There's only one cat roaring and that's the Lions. They are my NFC rep in the Super Bowl. 
<br></br>
Between the Giants and Jets, beat writers in New York must be having a heyday.  What a pair of pathetic franchises. From the Giants dropping an 18 point lead with less than six minutes left in the game for the first time in more than 50 years of football to the Jets failing to score a touchdown in the first half for the sixth straight games, it's a comedy that has no New York football fans laughing. And it goes on year after year. As you remind yourself of the many things you are grateful for each night before you go to bed, not being a fan of either of those franchises is a thankful recitation. As I mentioned last week, dysfunctional teams do dysfunctional things, and more often than not, it starts at the top. The Jets, the Titans, the Dolphins, the Panthers. All dysfunctional teams, all dysfunctional owners. Hell, you could throw JJ in there. If he wouldn't have traded Micah Parsons, the Cowboys would be a playoff team. He claimed the run defence would be stronger because of the trade. Statistically ,the Cowboys now have the worst run defence in the league.

You have to pass two tests to legally drive a car, written and driven. You have to pass zero tests to own a professional sports team. You either show up with the biggest bag of cash or you have to be related to the right person. There's no reason to believe they know how to own or operate a team. The one thing they probably do know is how to make money. And if nothing else, NFL franchises make money. Even after forking out $280 million in salaries, NFL team owners are still in the black before walk-up sales, sales of jerseys and apparel, and any of the other endless streams of revenue are factored in. Instead of hiring the right people and listening to people who know more about football than they do, they force themselves into the functioning of the team. We're talking about Woody Johnson, David Tepper, Stephen Ross, Amy Adams Strunk. The record of those teams this year is 5-23. If you're a fan of these franchises, you're stuck, forever following the follies of the owner who doesn't know his or her place. That's a problem. Maybe they should be corporations. Maybe they should have a Board of Directors. Maybe they should have competent CEOs rather than owners who don't understand that ungodly wealth, unless used properly, doesn't translate to a winning football team.

A good majority of the time I would normally have allocated to the writing of this week's report was instead dedicated to the mind-bending mental gymnastics of initiating and establishing our online payment system. This was accomplished through a three hour Facetime conversation with Daryl on Tuesday and a second Facetime call with Roudy and Daryl earlier today. The chances of having an online payment system without the assistance of Daryl and Roudy are about the same as Tennessee making the playoffs. In other words, not happening. I've never delved that deep into a computer. For someone who asks little of his computer, and has no more than a passing understanding of the bare-bones required to make it functional, it was more than a little overwhelming, but everything appears on the up and up. So rather than have that $100 (CDN) continue to burn a hole in your pocket, when you go to the site, go to the <strong>Payments Page</strong> and ante up. It accepts <strong>Euros, American dollars and Canadian dollars</strong>.

A whopping nine of 13 games on this week's slate are dbs. I don't care who you are, if you're 1-5 you shouldn't be a 5.5 point favourite over a 4-2 opponent. See Chicago-Baltimore. And after winning a game 31-6, albeit against a very bad and getting worse Dolphins team, you shouldn't be a seven-point underdog to a team that won 4 games last year. See Cleveland-New England. Although, the Patriots could win the Super Bowl this year. Maye put up a tidy 21-23/235 and 3 tds in Tennessee last Sunday. The Disruptor was right. You'll get a heavy dosage of Pats news and notes from here on in. On Monday, in one of the few occasions it may happen in a tear, you've got the big four of North American sports happening in one night. You've got baseball seasons happening in November and hockey seasons ending in June. What's wrong with this picture?
