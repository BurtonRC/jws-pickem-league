Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
I'm pulling a Chicago this week; taking a bye. There.s a couple nuggets I'll pass along, but little else. Again this week, I'm so thoroughly disgusted with my picking. Falling on the wrong side of many closely-contested games has completely sapped whatever will I had spew my usual nonsense.
<br></br>
Three of the league's Irish contingent went to the Viking-Steelers game in Dublin; Bubba, Fran and Daryl. Bubba shared his note with the group earlier in the week. Bubba is a born and bred Minnesotan with strong Viking connections. His father wrote for Sports Illustrated and covered Viking games for a Minnespolis daily. He's a transplanted Dubliner and there was no way he was going to let a Vikings game in Dublin go unattended. Also one of the nicest men you'll ever meet. Daryl, Fran and a couple of his mates had a howl up at Croke Park and after the game carried on at a pub up in Phibsboro, close to Fran's place. The picture of Daryl and Fran at the bottom was taken before the pints started tipping. Daryl shared some stories with me earlier in the day. I can't do them justice. Needless to say, copious amounts of Guinness was consumed, the Europeans won the Ryder Cup and people eventually got home in one piece. The actual game was a dud, with Pittsburgh handed another victory through the horrendous play of their opponents. They've got the regal colors of purple and gold, but often the Vikings play like a bunch of paupers. The Steelers are 3-1 and leading the AFC Central, but no one can convince me that is a playoff-caliber team. Everything is screens and quick release passing because Rodgers doesn't want to get hit. But the rest of the division stinks, including the Ravens. The speculation of LaMar's injury is all over the map, but it's likely he'll be out the next 2-3 weeks. They're 1-3 and could easily be 1-6 or 2-5 by the time he returns, with postseason play a big maybe. No matter how you slice it, they'll be looking at another tough road through the playoffs - provided they can make it there.

Cincinnati had gained less than 150 yards through its first three games making it a one-dimensional offence with a back-up quarterback leading the way. Couple that with a bad head coach, a miserable defence and a miserly owner and you have the Bengals. On Monday, they churned out less than 150 total yards, with more penalties than first downs. The importance of having a decent back-up quarterback in this league can't be overstated. 
<br></br>
Dallas isn't very good, but they have treated us to two of the best games of the year. I think the Sunday night game told us more about the Packers, than it did about the Cowboys. Dallas has one way to win; with offence. Dak Prescott is an elite quarterback even without CeeDee Lamb, one of the three or four best receivers in the league. With the Micah Persons trade, Green Bay was supposed to be one of the most complete teams in football. On Sunday, their defence couldn't get off the field, Jordan Love only attempted a handful of passes more than five yards down the field, and their game-tying field goal in overtime was a masterclass in bad clock management. It's early in the year and they'll use their bye to clean up some of the inefficiencies, but I don't think they're better than Detroit and will have to take the wildcard path to any further riches.
<br></br>
After a 26-0 loss to the previously winless Texans, the Titans are 0-4, averaging fewer than 13 points a game, and have more turnovers than touchdowns. With a second-year coach and a rookie quarterback, the word rebuilding is often bandied about. Thing is, I can actually see them getting worse before things get turned around. Their first-year GM never hired Callahan and you know he's chomping at the bit to get rid of him. GMs want their own coach, and when the coach is under-qualified and marshalling a winless team, the urgency is even stronger. But they bet big on Cam Ward getting them out of the AFC basement. Do you want to to burden the talented, but raw, Ward with a second coach inside a year?  It's a mess and why am I wasting my time talking about one of the worst teams in the league? It makes no sense. Kind of like my picks last week.

Vikings and Steelers in Dublin!

<br></br>
A couple quick facts:
<br></br>
Kansas City isn't going anywhere. The impending demise has been overstated. See you in the playoffs.
<br></br>
Pacu Nacua is currently the best receiver in the league. Through 4 games, he's caught 16 more passes than his nearest competition and has more than a 100 yards more yards.
<br></br>
Tyrek Hill, Nick Bosa, Joe Burrow, Mailk Nabors; the season-ending injuries are mounting. The game isn't as good with them not in it. 
<br></br>
Brian Daboll desperately needed a win. I'm not sure how many more Jaxson Dart will deliver for him this year. That's not really a fact, just suspicion.
<br></br>
I took the week off and my brother is in town from Vancouver Island next week. I can't promise you much next week either, which can be seen as a good thing.
<br></br>
I'll do better in both my picking and reports after that.
