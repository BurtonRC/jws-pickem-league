Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
This is going to be a short report. I lost it after the Rams squandered a 19-point lead and numerous other opportunities to put away the Eagles. It’s not like I had my firstborn riding on the outcome, but it was a point I desperately wanted, if for no other reason, I loathe the Eagles. I didn’t tune in again until the evening game because I didn’t want my survivor pick to suffer the same fate as Rams or the Pats and throw my entire week off. 
<br><br>
The Pats had five turnovers against Pittsburgh. Drake Maybe threw a horrendous pick in the endzone and Stevenson fumbled on the 1-yard line. It was a game they never should have lost. In the final three quarters of the game they outgained the Steelers, 349 to 101. If you only win one battle in a game, win the turnover battle. At least then, you still have a chance to win the war.  In 1975, the Pats had 50 turnovers in a 14-game schedule. That's averaging more than three turnovers per game. 
<br><br>
The two leading receivers for Kansas City against the Giants were Taquon Thorton and Juju Smith-Schuster, both cast-offs from the Pats. Not sure what this says about either club. Chiefs kicker, Harrison Butker, has missed four kicks in the last two games. I don’t care how many clutch games he’s won them in the past, with kickers, it’s always  “what have you done for me lately”. 
<br><br>
I tried to put a positive spin on the Burrow injury. Browning had been serviceable in the past. But once defensive coordinators have seen tape of a Browning-led offence, especially one as fierce as Brian Flores, you have to show them something new and different. Zach Talor didn’t and his team got rag-dolled. At this point, I’m ready to abandon all hope for the Bengals. To be fair to Browning, he didn’t get much support from his teammates. The pass protection was just as leaky as it was for Burrow, and Zach Taylor has’t figured out a run game five years in. The shit show Cincinnati put on this week was a total team effort. 
<br><br>
Spencer Rattler is 0-3 for the year and 0-10 in his career. The record for quarterback losses to start a career is 0-15. The Saints are so bad that unless they pull him for someone even worse, he has a very good chance to set the new standard. 
<br><br>
The Jets and the Giants are a combined 0-6 so far this year. What is the worst combined record of New York teams in an NFL season? 7-25 in 1996.  Thank you Rich Kotite and Dan Reeves. 
<br><br>
Carolina beat Atlanta 30-0. When was the last time a four-point favourite got shutout? I asked Chat GPT and it couldn't even conjure a proper response. 
<br><br>
The Chargers win on the Sunday night game didn't feel like a Chargers game. If that game was played anytime in the last two decades, they would have blown that game. Coming back from 20-13 in the fourth quarter and winning the game with a field goal in the final minute is very unCharger-like. That's what teams did to San Diego / Los Angeles for years ad nauseum. Denver will win a lot of games with that defence, but that offence is still a work in progress. 
<br><br>
Houston won the AFC South last year and won a playoff game. They're 0-3 this year, scoring a wretched 38 points along the way. 
<br><br>
Indiana Jones and the Indianapolis Colts haven't punted through their first three games. The only other team to punt less than five times through the first three games of a season is the 2007 Patriots. Not bad company. By the by, Indiana  Jones is one of the favourites for Comeback Player of the Year. What's he coming back from? Being shitty. 
<br><br>
Forget the tush push. You know what else should be outlawed by the NFL? Sons called Brian of famous NFL coaches. I present as evidence Brian Callahan of the Tennessee Titans and Brian Schottenheimer of the Dallas Cowboys. Some things are transferable from father to son; bad manners, a strange facial countenance, wealth. Some aren't, like coaching acumen. Dallas must have the worst coaching staff in the league. After getting run out of Chicago after making a bad team worse, JJ, in his infinite wisdom, asks Matt Eberflus to be his new defensive coordinator. What are you thinking? You trade away one of the premier defensive players in the league and hire a defensive coordinator who’d be a better fit on a high school team.  Caleb Williams hadn't looked that comfortable since playing at USC. A week earlier, Russ Wilson touched the Cowboys secondary for 500 yards. It could get ugly with an unhappy Packer team coming to town on Sunday. 
<br><br>
I’m not going to say anything about the Ravens-Lions other than it didn’t turn out the way I thought it would. The Lions sacked LaMar seven times. You don’t get seven sacks against LaMar without a concentrated and disciplined effort by the defensive front to hold their lanes and keep LaMar in the pocket. Even that’s no guarantee of him not ripping off a 30-yard run. I’m 0-3 in the point spread game of the week. Thank God I’m  not a gambler. 
<br><br>
Sorry for the sub-par report. If the Rams had’ve won, it would have been much better. Once again, cranking this out with my mobile at the lake. 
<br><br>
Don’t forget the early Sunday game in Dublin this week. I don’t think any of our Irish contingent are going to the game, at least I hadn’t heard. If anyone is, I want a full report for next week.  
<br><br>
Regards,
<br><br>
