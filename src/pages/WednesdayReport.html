Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
Well, that's a wrap; the end of another NFL Pick'em season. As for the NFL, the actual league where they play the games, they still have the playoffs and the crowning of this year's Super Bowl Champion.  But as for our little league, it's now in the books. And the winner, after an  incredible comeback in the back half of the year, including back-to-back 14s in the final weeks, is Matt Wyndels. He edged out former champion, Jake Giezbrecht, by one. The Dublin Cowboy, Daryl Krywonis, captured third. 
<br></br>
There are 37 participants in the league, translating to $3700. Taking away the entry fee for Roudy, who administers the site and does so for less than a child labourer in a third world country, and Adam Treleaven, who despite repeated requests (emails) from the Disputor (Eric) and myself has refused to ante up, we're reduced to $3500. 
<br></br>
Here's the breakdown:
<br></br>
<strong>Champion</strong> - Matt Wyndels - $1900
<strong>Second</strong> - Jake Giesbrecht - $930
<strong>Third</strong> - Daryl Krywonis - $300
<br></br>
<strong>Survivor Champ</strong> - Jake Giesbrecht - $370
<br></br>
Congratulations to all our winners. I'm taking a pass on the playoff pool this year. My earlier solicitation didn't generate a lot of interest, and I fear we're too close to Saturday to make a proper go at it. If someone is interested in running it, I would participate. 
<br></br>
I'm not going to sentimentalize all the virtues of the league. I've done that before. For all its flaws and deficiencies, it is what it is; a simple recreational outlet for football fans to exercise their interest in the game through monetary manners. We'll attempt to iron out all its shortcomings before the start of the next season. A big thanks to everyone being part of the Pick'em League. We'll be back next year. I hope you'll join us. 
<br></br>
Regards,
<br></br>
