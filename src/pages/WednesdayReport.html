Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
As mentioned last week, my bro is in town, which takes precedence, even over the Pick'em League.
<br></br>
God damn Cardinals! Only the most untrustworthy team in the NFL could have lost that game to Tennessee and thrown me out of the Survivor Series. Screw them all with a rusted crankshaft.
<br></br>
I'll be back with you next week, like it or not.
<br><br>
Regards,
<br><br>
<strong> John Wyndels<br>
Commissioner, NFL Pick'em</strong>
