Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
It's crunch time; in the league and in our little competition. Christmas Day, which the NBA had traditionally owned with four televised games starting in the morning and ending in the evening, will have to share Jesus's birthday for the first time with the NFL. Three games that probably looked good when initially scheduled will be lacking the high-stakes fervor of many other Week 17 games. <strong>Two more games on the early slate Saturday.</strong> 
<br></br>
Wishing all of you the very best this holiday season. May your plate, glass and stocking be full. 
<br></br>
Regards,
<br></br>
<strong> John Wyndels<br>
Commissioner, NFL Pick'em</strong>
