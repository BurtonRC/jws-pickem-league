Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.  With three last-minute wins and half of the 16 games this past week ending as one score games, the NFL has never been so competitive, nor so popular.  It set a viewership record for Week 1 with an average of 22.3 million viewers per game. Just to put into context how the popularity of football is dwarfing other professional sports, the men's final of the US Open Tennis Championship between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannick Sinner, the number one and two ranked players in the world, which aired at the same time as first NFL games of the year, had a viewership of 1.6 million.  So for every one person watching the tennis final, one of the four majors of the calendar year, featuring one of the players who may go down as the best tennis player of all-time, ahead of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, there were fifteen people watching the Carolina / Jacksonville game.  That's incredible.  And the numbers for week 2 are even more impressive. The Super Bowl LIX rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles during Sunday’s late-afternoon window earned a staggering audience of 33.8 million viewers.

There are any number of reasons the NFL is so popular, none more so than convenience and consistency. It's September. It's Sunday. It's noon. It's football. You don't have to think about it. You can count on it like the sun rising in the east. Sure, there may be additional games on Monday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday, but you know without exception, there will be a slate of games, starting Sunday at 12 Noon (CST).  It's easy. If you're so inclined and opportunity presents itself, you can waste away the entire afternoon, or day for that matter, watching football. Basic cable will give you at least two games in the opening window, and with an endless suite of NFL packages, you can go quadbox without watching Redzone. Shut down your life and the world around you. Of course, you might feel guilty as hell the next day when you realize you frittered away a perfectly good Sunday, when there's a limited number of them left before the cold winds of October start blowing, but it's comforting, kind of like a warm blanket.  And who doesn't want a warm blanket?

The football wasn't of the highest quality, after all we're talking about the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants, but they did put on the most entertaining game of the season thanks to a wild fourth-quarter that saw the lead change hands five times in the fourth quarter before regulation ended in a 37-37 tie, with kicker Brandon Aubrey hitting a walk-off field goal in OT to give the Cowboys a win. The game wouldn’t have made it to overtime if not for Aubrey’s 64-yard field goal as time expired.  And the Cowboys were so confident that Aubrey would drill it, they decided to set it up with a run on the previous two plays rather than ask Dak Prescott to pass it downfield to set up a shorter field goal attempt.  I suppose when you have a kicker who has made four field goals of 60 yards or more in just two-plus seasons, you don’t have to manage a game sensibly and can get away with Mike McCarthy–esque bullshit.  A couple other things of note; Malik Nabors is really good and Russell Wilson's strong performance bought himself another game against a frustrated Chiefs team before he gets the hook for the season.

The Pittsburgh Steelers have the most expensive defence in football.  It's filled with stars, like TJ Watt, Micah Fitzpatrick and Alex Highsmith.  When you put that much capital in one side of the ball, you want some results.  Not happening.  They ended last year on a five-game losing streak, largely attributable to the defence, and they've picked up this year where they left us last year.  They rank near the bottom in every defensive category after giving up 31 to points to Sam Darnold and the Seahawks and 32 points to Justin Fields and the Jets in back-to-back weeks.  Defence has long been the Steelers calling card.  if you could count on one thing from a Mike Tomlin coached team, aside from a winning record every year for his entire 18 year career, it was a stout defence, one that forced turnovers and got after opposing quarterbacks.  They aren't even doing that anymore.  One of Tomlin's many quotables quotes is, "The standard is the standard".   But when that standard is no longer being consistently met, undisciplined football is what we should come to expect in Pittsburgh.

What's more shocking?  That the Cincinnati Bengals are 2-0 for the first time since 2018 or Joe Burrow will be out three months for turf toe?  Turf toe?  If something is going to take you out of the line-up for three months, at least give the injury a name condign with the severity the imposition imposes.  How about Hallux axis dislocation?  Who the hell knows what a hallux axis means, but it sounds nasty and painful and requires three months of recovery time.  At the same time, we shouldn't be surprised.  This is the third time in Burrow's six year career that he will have missed an extended period of a season.  You know why? His offensive line sucks.  They've been bad every year he's been with the Bengals. with no sign of getting better.  Why sign your quarterback to a five year $275 million contract when he's under constant pressure and threat of injury everytime he drops back?  You're soliciting danger.  It's like buying a Porsche, parking it in your driveway with both doors open and keys in the ignition.  What could possibly go wrong?  The good news is Zach Taylor has experience drawing up game plans for back-up Jake Browning.  And truth be told, he might be the best back-up quarterback in the league.  Jimmy G might get some votes, but the Bengals can still win with Browning.  You're giving up talent and to adopt a scheme that fits with Browning's talents, but there are worse-case scenarios.  It's when Browning gets hurt because the offensive line can't protect him that things will get a little dicey.

Kyle Shanahan made no secret of wanting the 49ers to draft Mac Jones with the third pick in the 2021 NFLdraft.  Instead they took Trey Lance, who is now on his third NFL team.  Mac Jones went to New England, flamed out after a couple years with the Pats, and is now also with his third team, and with the coach that was so enamored with him years earlier.  If one game is anything to go by, it's a good fit. Jones, who is filling in for injured Niners starter Brock Purdy, was solid, if unspectacular, going 26 for 39 and 279 yards and three touchdowns, no picks.  If he could have put those numbers up more often with the Pats, Bill Belichick might still be in New England, not North Carolina, on the short leash of a 25 year-old garden variety social media influencer.  Do I judge BB unfavourably for having a girlfriend 50 years his junior?  Yeah, I do, but not as much as having the greatest football coach of all-time coaching college ball at a no-name college football program. Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

Which brings us to the story of the weekend.  The Kansas City Chiefs are 0-2 for the first time in the Mahones era.  Throw in last year's shit-kicking in the Super Bowl against the very same opponent they played on Sunday and they've lost three games in a row.  Sure, it's commonplace for NFL franchises to lose three games in a row.  The thing is, the Kansas City Chiefs with Mahones at quarterback is not like most NFL franchises.  They represented the AFC in five of the last six Super Bowls, winning three of them.  That's heady stuff.  Teams like the Chiefs with Mahones shouldn't find themselves mired in three game tailspins like your average run-of-the-mill NFL franchise.  So are they cooked?  Are they fine?  Are they somewhere in-between?  I know I gave them a 6.5 on the panic meter last week, but despite an 0-2 record, it's way too early to quit on the Chiefs. 
<br><br>
The truth is, a team with Patrick Mahones at quarterback is already in the top 20 percent of NFL teams.  The floor of a Mahones-led offence is higher than 80 percent of teams.  In fact, with the exception of the Buffalo Bills and the Baltimore Ravens, with John Allen and LaMar Jackson respectively, you couldn't name another AFC franchise that, given the choice, wouldn't swap places with the Chiefs this year.  Maybe the Chargers, but I'd pump the brakes on the powder blue before we go too far down that road.  Even if they're playing poorly, and they most certainly are, you can't name seven other teams in the AFC better than they are.  The chances are better than average that even if this is the worst version of the Chiefs they will be good enough to get to the playoffs.  And once they defy the odds and become a team that overcomes an 0-2 start and still makes the playoffs, given their history and pedigree, the Chiefs are not a team others will want to meet in the postseason. 
<br><br>
The games they lost this year they would have won last year.  Not because the team is fundamentally different, but because they were 10-0 in one-score games last year.  If you look at it honestly, last year the Chiefs were a 12-win team that won 15 games.  This year they could be a 12 win team that wins 10 games.  Right now, the football isn't bouncing their way.  The Kelce bobbled-ball interception at the goal-line that turned the game didn't happen last year.  And chances are it won't be happening later this year because with Rice and Worthy back, and a trade that brings Tyrek Hill back to his old stomping ground, they probably won't be throwing the ball to Kelce in those kinds of situations.  What is different is they are no longer the powerhouse that they were four or five years ago when they were blowing out teams 35-3 with alarming regularity.  They've got no running game.  Mahones in his scrambles escaping the pocket had more yards on the ground than their running backs.  But if you watched that game, Mahones was playing it like it was the Super Bowl.  For the first time in his career, there is actual doubt about how good his team is.  They haven't played well.  I don't like watching them, and they aren't nearly as good as the Chiefs teams from before, but the formula is stay afloat, get into the playoffs where they will have new personnel and have figured out a lot of stuff that currently isn't working.

In our WhatsApp public forum with participants from the fantasy football league I'm in the with Andrew, he asked why other teams don't do a variation of the tush push, given Philadelphia has a 99.5 percent success rate with it and the refs seem willing to give Eagles centre a pass when they line up above the ball, not behind it, and will turn a blind eye to offensive linemen jumping the count? Great question. ESPN did an article on it Monday.
