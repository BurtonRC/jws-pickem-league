Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
After writing half a report about the Chiefs and how they're not dead yet, I was agog to see them silently flame out over this past weekend. 
<br></br>
Like scrooge, I've got nothing for you. It wasn't planned that way. It's just the way it worked out. Got behind doing a lot of nothing and it snowballed. Meanwhile, you're all busy with Christmas cooking, baking, decorating, entertaining, carousing, imbibing, over-indulging. Stay the course. Enjoy your holidays. It only comes once a year.  The next report will be Christmas Eve, which will be even more threadbare than what you have before you.
<br></br>
Heads up for the two games on Saturday. The Thursday game is one of the biggest of the year to this point. Even with the tiny point spread, it merits being a two point game. All the best.
<br></br>
Regards,
<br></br>
