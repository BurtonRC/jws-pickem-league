Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
Most serious football observers would tell you the football season starts after American Thanksgiving. The trade deadline has passed. What teams have is a pretty good indicator of what teams will have moving forward; its strengths as well as its flaws. The previous 13 weeks have given them a guide of what they do well and how they may match up with other teams, for the better or for the worse. There are currently about 20 teams, 10 in each conference, that are still in play for a playoff berth. That's a very generous number, but let's go with it for simplicity's sake. A number of them are playing for seedings (Denver, New England, Seattle, LA Rams). A number of others, including pre-season Super Bowl favourites (Kansas City, Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia) are fighting for the opportunity to play in the postseason. Half of the Week 14 slate features games between teams currently in the playoffs and/or just on the outside looking in, including a pair of loser leaves town matches where the loser's chances will be for all intents and purposes, gone. Let's start there and the Thursday night tilt between the Cowboys and the Lions. 
<br></br>
I would have never believed that Detroit would be playing for their playoff lives in Week 14. But here they are 7-5 and most definitely on the outside looking in. They've lost to a number of teams ahead of them in the standings and face a formidable road ahead, starting Thursday. The Cowboys beat last year's Super Bowl participants, the Eagles and the Chiefs, in a four day window, and the team that many, myself included, were treating as roadkill earlier in the month, have a path to the postseason. They'll likely have to win all five, starting in Motor City. I didn't like the trade that brought Pickens to Dallas from Pittsburgh. Although a bona-fide blue-chip receiver with huge upside, the Steelers, a team with no receivers other than  D.K. Metcalfe were willing to pass Pickens off to Dallas for a future third-round pick. Why? Because he was toxic, inside the locker room and on the field. I don't know whether he's transformed to a model teammate in Dallas, but he and CeeDee Lamb have combined to form the most potent receiving tandem in the league, reviving a team left for dead into a unit no one wants to meet in the postseason. The defence, that was last in the league and bleeding yards and points earlier the year following the Micah Parson trade, have solidified following the trade for Quentin Williams and a number of injured players returning to the line-up, including DeMarvion Overshown. This doesn't even look like the same team from a month or more ago. Everything has to fall right for Dallas to get in, but the way they're playing, I wouldn't put it past them. Even then, I'm not giving JJ any credit. We all know this won't work out because we're talking about the Cowboys, and in the end, JJ will get the one thing he desperately wanted to avoid; the annual, long. drawn-out, very public contract dispute with his newest star, George Pickens. 
<br></br>
I still have difficulty imagining the football playoffs without Kansas City. They've been to five Super Bowls in the last seven years, winning three of them. In the two Super Bowls they failed to get to during that seven-year tenure, they lost the AFC Championship game in overtime. It still doesn't hold a candle to the six championships and 20-year reign of the Patriots, but a mini-dynasty all the same. Truth is, if this was any other team than the Chiefs, we would say they're done, finito, no mas. But this isn't any other team. This is the Chiefs, the red and gold you know you have to get past if you want to go to the big game. Until they are mathematically eliminated, I can't dispel the thought of them slipping in as the seven-seed and wreaking havoc. That's the grace you're granted when you're a proven winner.  But all that winning adds up. Add a month to every football season for seven years and you have a 12 year-veteran instead of a 10 year-veteran.  That's a lot of extra football.  Is that the reason the team that went 11-0 in one-score games last year is 1-5 this year? No, those things have a tendency of evening out if you increase the sample size. Simply put, the Chiefs are making mistakes and failing to do the little things they did in the past. A Mahones pick, a costly penalty, a missed tackle. Close games you just assume would fall to the Chiefs haven't to the point they must win-out to get in. And it's not going to be easy starting with the Texans. Coming off victories against the Bills and the Colts, they have to stay ahead of the Chiefs to give themselves a chance. Like Dallas-Detroit, the loser here is done. 
<br></br>
After anointing the Rams as the team to beat, they promptly go out and lose to Carolina. The Rams moved the ball up and down the field and were stymied more by their own mistakes than anything the Panthers did. Counting on uncharacteristic mistakes from Stafford isn't going to win you a lot of games against them. The loss didn't diminish the Rams in my eyes. The Packers, who for large periods of time can look like the dullest team in football, took off the training wheels and beat Detroit with aggressive play-calling and fourth-down conversions. This weekend they take on the NFC-leading, Chicago Bears. How is this team 9-3? It defies explanation. They've made great strides under Ben Johnson and have a base to build on, but this isn't a team I take seriously. They have Green Bay twice, San Francisco and Detroiut coming home. I can see them winning one of their last five and finishing 10-7. I have no idea who will win the NFC, but I'd still give the Rams and the Seahawks the inside track. I'm equally flummoxed by the AFC. The 11-2 Patriots have won ten in a row and sit atop the AFC, but let's not forget this team was 4-13 last year. A new coach, a burgeoning quarterback and a draft class that hit across the board cannot cover all the cracks. They do a lot of things well, but their defensive and offensive red-zone stats are appalling. The Pats had 10 cracks from the one in two seperate drives last week in Cincinnati and got a total of 3 points. They were in the red-zone five times on Monday against the Giants and settled for four field goals. That won't get it done in the playoffs. Denver is winning a flurry of one-score games and has a defence that will keep them in most games, but no one not drinking orange crush believes that offence can win in the postseason. Indianapolis is being led by a disgraced former-Giant quarterback and Jacksonville is simply not a contender. Those are your first four seeds in the AFC as it currently stands. None of the big boys (Kansas City, Buffalo, Baltimre) have punched their ticket and one, two or all of them may miss out. Perhaps they are not the big boys anymore. Their Super Bowl window is closing or may have closed and they've been usurped by the young upstart Pats and Broncos and Texans. My eyes tell me Denver, Indianapolis, Jacksonville and the LA Chargers won't win the AFC. We might have a better idea after Week 14. 
<br></br>
Sorry for the very pedestrian report. I got to it late and the writing and analysis reflects that. I solemnly pledge to do better next week provided I have the ability to change my mind.
