Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
It's 2:30 p.m., December 31, New Year's Eve. I am slavishly trying to get the house presentable for some people coming over this evening. I haven't given the Wednesday Report an iota of thought and that's the way we're going to end the year. Twelve of the fourteen playoff teams have been established. The two outstanding spots are the NFC South Champion and the AFC Central champion. If Carolina beats Tampa Bay on Saturday, they win the NFC South. If Tampa Bay wins, everything is contingent on the New Orleans at Atlanta game on Sunday afternoon. An Atlanta victory would have a three-way tie of Carolina, Tampa Bay and Atlanta at 8-9..The tie-breaking rules would crown Carolina and put them in fourth seed in the NFC. The AFC Central champion is not nearly as complicated: Baltimore at Pittsburgh with the winner being the fourth seed in the AFC. At the time of this being written, we still don't know if LaMar is playing. If Huntley can be close to how well he performed in Green Bay last weekend, Baltimore should go through. This coming from a guy in the bottom quarter of a 37 person competition. One of the constants I have held since the beginning of the year is Pittsburgh is a poor football team. I haven't wavered. Only good fortune has them where they are. With Metcalf in the stands after attacking an individual in the stands, they don't have a downfield game. Mind you, they hardly had a downfield passing game when he was in the line-up. Hopefully, this is sayonara for Rodgers. I won't miss him. For Baltimore, the game plan is simple; run Henry. I'm taking Baltimore all day.

The late game Saturday is for the number one seed in the NFC: Seattle at San Francisco. I would have never imagined San Fran would be in this position a month into the season. They lost Nick Bosa and Fred Warner for the year, two of the best players at their position in the league. Brock Purdy and their All-Pro tight end, George Kittle, missed eight games a piece. Not to mention that flake, Aiyuk. Somehow, Kyle Shanahan has plugged in backups and schemed his way to playing for the NFC title. Seattle has a great defence; San Francisco doesn't have a defence. San Francisco has a great offence; Seattle has an inconsistent offence. Darnold's play the last two games has been less than stellar and has proven time and again, he's not who you want behind center when the chips are down. That being said, he sits with Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and one other who I can't recall as the only quarterbacks to have back to back 13 win seasons. In Darnold's case, with two different teams. Meanwhile, Purdy is playing the best football of his career with no wideouts within a sniff of a thousand yards. San Francisco won their first meeting in Seattle, 17-13 for what that's worth. I think it's a toss-up with Seattle giving 2.5. Give me San Fran.

The Chargers are resting everyone against Denver, including Justin Herbert. Thinking getting healthy is more imperative than what seed they end up, they have consigned themselves to the seventh barring unexpected results from Buffalo and Houston, who are prohibitive favourites. Doing so hands Denver the AFC title. a first-round bye and home field advantage through the playoffs. New England will want to retain the second spot, not ceding it to Jacksonville who sits in third. Two Patriot stars, Stefon Diggs and Christian Barnmore are facing felony charges in separate incidents this summer. Diggs for strangulation and Barnmore for assault and battery. Lovely. Neither player will be disciplined by the NFL pending trial and will be eligible for the playoffs. How Vrabel views these things, I cannot say. Denver, New England and Jacksonville are top three seeds in the AFC. I'll bet there were some good odds on that at the beginning of the season.

No games Thursday, two on Saturday and the rest on Sunday. We'll work out the early games feature next season, not forcing you to make selections on Thursday for games played in the early window on Sunday. There are a number of features that we will be playing with gearing up to next year, depending on Roudy's continuing administration. There's a lot we can do, but there's a lot that we've accomplished. Let's build on what we have. I hope the season has been enjoyable and I promise we will do our utmost to get most things right next year. 
<br></br>
There's a lot of shuffling at the top of the leaderboard with seven within six of the lead. Six points can be made up in a week, just ask Daryl and Jake. The "user's picks" feature is closed and should have been closed earlier, in the case of the unscrupulous peering into other individuals' selections. That's on me and I apologize, as well as the on-again off-again Wednesday Reports. I'll provide a short round-up next week when we know the winners. 
<br></br>
Happy New Year to you and yours. Wishing you all the best in 2026. 
<br></br>
Should we have a playoff pool like previous years? Let me know.  
<br></br>
Regards,
<br></br>
