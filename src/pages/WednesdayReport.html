Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
My profound apologies to members of the NFL Pick’em League for the disservice of once again failing to deliver a substantive, albeit deeply flawed, weekly report. I remain on the Injured Reserve designation.
<br></br>
My status beyond this week has yet to be determined. Factors beyond my control constrain my ability to be clearly identify a date for my return to action. Please accept this protracted inconvenience. 
<br></br>
Regards,
<br></br>
<strong> John Wyndels<br>
Commissioner, NFL Pick'em</strong>
