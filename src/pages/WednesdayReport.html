Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
I had an appointment with my surgeon this morning, Good news. Stitches out. Brace off. Leg bending at the knee at ninety degrees. All indications positive. I will get back in my wheelchair later today.  I am overjoyed I will be returning to normal (normal being a relative term) once I get some of my strength back and weeks ahead of the schedule laid out to me earlier. I do not attribute this to any super recuperative powers. Once in a while, good fortune smiles on you. 
<br></br>
The Wednesday Report will return next week. Again, my apologies for disruption to the service and greatly appreciate the words of encouragement from fellow Pick'em participants. I feel like getting blind drunk, but perhaps a celebratory puff tonight would be the better recourse.
<br></br>
Not getting Hollywood on you, but mind your health. It is the single most important thing you have. You can't fully love all the other things you have or want to do if you're not healthy. 
<br></br>
No more maudlin public service announcements. Let's get back to football.
