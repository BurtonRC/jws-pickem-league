Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
Despite what a lot of prognosticators are telling you, the Chiefs aren't dead. If they win their final four games, they have a slightly better than 50 percent chance of making the playoffs, although that number seems to be changing daily. The prediction models you've seen or heard of place those odds at anywhere from 8 to 16 percent because they don't see a 6-7 team winning four games in a row, including games against the 9-4 Chargers next week and the 11-2 Broncos in Arrowhead on Christmas Day.. There are also a number of other factors at play, not the least being how Buffalo, Houston, and the Chargers fare in their final four, but I guarantee you, if the Chiefs win their next couple games, which they will do, and play the Broncos knowing a win and they're in because they have the Raiders in Week 18, I would wager my house they beat the Broncos. I say this knowing Andy Reid has lost his marbles, the general manager has elected to stand pat for years while the team deteriorated, the decimated offensive line can't block and receivers can't catch. The one and only thing that prevents me from completely writing the Chiefs off is Patrick Mahones, who suffered the worst statistical games of his career on Sunday. I don't know the actual number of balls Kansas City receivers dropped, but I counted at least six, including the bone-headed fourth down call on their own 31 in a 10-10 game with 10 minutes left and all the momentum on their side. To steal an analogy from another sport, Andy Reid has lost his fastball. The team around Mahones is average, but Reid's coaching is not only not making up for it, but making the whole thing worse with unusual lapses in judgement and a complete absence of creative play calling that had long been Big Red's calling card. Missing the playoffs with one of the most talented quarterbacks this league has ever seen and a very favorable schedule would typically be viewed as a fireable offense. That’s not likely to happen here, but the reality is that right now the Chiefs are a poorly coached team that lacks high-end talent outside of the quarterback position. After saying all that, if the Chiefs do get into the playoffs, in an AFC field of mostly good, but flawed teams, I'm still not ready to bury them. That says as much about the other teams as it does about the Chiefs. For example, the Broncos are the current one seed in the AFC. They're 11-2 with a +73 point differential. The Chief's point differential is +63 and they're 6-7. The team in the best position to slip up and give the Chiefs a lifeline are the Chargers. It could very likely come down to a Week 18 match between Denver and the LA Chargers. Denver wins, Kansas City probably gets in. Knowing that, Does Denver want to win that game? If they're fighting the Pats for home-field advantage, they'll be all in. If they've got nothing to gain but letting a long-time foe back in with a loss, they're just as likely to play dead and roll over. The Chargers face a murderer's row coming home; @ Chiefs, @ Cowboys, Texans, @ Denver. Somehow, someway, they beat the Eagles on Monday night. Neither of these teams are very good right now. The Chargers are missing three starters on the offensive line and can't keep Herbert upright. He got sacked seven times and it could have been worse if he didn't take the run option when the first hint of pressure came. Jalen Hurts plays worse every time I see him. A stat I heard on Tuesday; Hurts had 20 dropbacks Monday when he had more than 2.5 seconds to get rid of the ball. On those 20 passing attempts, he was 5/20 for 55 yards and four picks. Hard to imagine either of these teams doing anything come January. 
<br></br>
Nothing that happened in the NFC this past weekend has changed my view. The Rams and Seahawks beat up inferior opponents, Philly continued its freefall and the Packers resumed their one-sided rivalry with the Bears. We've been told all our lives that this is one of the NFL's greatest rivalries. but it'd be hard-pressed to come up with one moment from the last 30 years. Chicago hasn't won two straight games in this series for nearly 20 years, and after Green Bay''s 28-21 win on Sunday, the Packers have won 12 of the last 13 matchup between the teams. This isn't a rivalry; it's straight up bullying. Sunday’s game was the first of two meetings in a three-week span with the NFC North title in reach for both teams. If both teams take care of business next week—the Bears get Cleveland at home while Green Bay has a much tougher job going to Denver—that Week 16 game will decide first place in the division with just two weeks remaining. I'm still not "feeling the love" for Caleb who gets more out of broken plays and scrambling out of the pocket than precision passing or schemed plays drawn up by Ben Johnson. Chicago's loss transitioned them from first in the conference to seventh and final seed. After Cleveland, the Bears have the Packers again, the Niners and the Lions, who could still be very much alive for a wild-card spot. Their immediate challenge is beating the Rams on Sunday. A loss would have them seriously regretting a couple games they let get away earlier in the year.

It's hard to have any confidence in the NFL after seeing three clearly wrong calls by the refs award Pittsburgh a win in Baltimore. The catch rule was applied in two different circumstances. In the first instance they took away an interception because they determined Aaron Rodgers made a catch before he lost possession and the ball was caught by a Ravens defender. Not long after that, Isiah Likely had a touchdown taken off the board after replay review swept in and the receiver hadn't gotten his third step down. After the game, the NFL's vice president of instant replay (yes, that is his actual title) said,
<br></br> 
<i>“The receiver controlled the ball in the air, had his right foot down, then his left foot down. The control is the first aspect of the catch. The second aspect is two feet or a body part inbounds, which he did have. Then the third step is an act common to the game and before he could get the third foot down, the ball was ripped out. Therefore, it was an incomplete pass."</i>
<br></br>
That is flat-out wrong. Here’s the actual explanation from the rulebook with bold added for emphasis:
<br></br>
“(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and<br>
(b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and<br>
(c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, clearly performs any act common to the game (e.g., extend the ball forward, take an additional step, tuck the ball away and turn upfield, or avoid or ward off an opponent), or he maintains control of the ball long enough to do so.”
<br></br>
In both situations, the rulings on the field were disregarded. Clear and obvious evidence has to be found to overturn the ruling on the field. It appears that when they can't find something clear and obvious, the NFL, or the NFL Replay Review, are going rogue. The owners create the rules and only want replay review when the evidence is clear and obvious.  The NFL is going rogue on the replay review and they/re overturning things when they shouldn't. Back when the NFL hated gambling, the Commissioner said if you allow legalized gambling, normal incidents of the game will feed suspicion that the fix is in or something along that line. Well, that ship has sailed. Legalized gambling underwrites any football program you hear, read or watch. But when you have two plays that have a common thread, in this case application of the catch rule, and replay review is overturning rules on the field in defiance of the clear and obvious standard, I would say this does feed suspicion that the fix is in and something is up. It's not a good look when the NFL applies the replay review incorrectly and then doubles down and provides interpretation that is erroneous. Who's running this show?
<br></br>
We're into Week 15. I think I've provided ample time before I begin my exhortations for participants to pay their dues. To date, I've received 17, or about half of those dues owed. I'm not going to name names because you know who you are. I will not take to public shaming or direct individual emails quite yet.  Come on guys and gals, take ten minutes out of your busy day to send your dues my way. As anyone who's checked the Standings would know, the money's not for me. We incorporated the payment feature on the site for ease of access. Euros, Canadian dollars, American dollars; it accepts all.

I forgot to mention it last week. but after a protracted struggle against Drew, Jake the Snake won the Survivor Series. Congratulations Jake! Perhaps you should chime in and ask people to ante up. You're in a good position to do some serious collecting.
