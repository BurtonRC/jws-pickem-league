Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL; the American Thanksgiving edition. 🍂 🦃 🍂
<br></br>
Thursday's slate might be the best line-up I can recall, with all three games having playoff implications. They're already predicting the Kansas City - Dallas game will be the most viewed NFL regular-season game in history. Some suggest 50 million eyeballs. Cowboys, Chiefs, Thanksgiving; it's a confluence of the biggest brands in American culture. Throw in Taylor Swift sightings at Jerryworld and you've got a full-on extravaganza. The fact that both teams rescued their seasons with thrilling victories last week only makes the stakes higher. Another loss by either team could be a death blow to their postseason hopes. And if you think the NFL’s decision to pit its two most-watched teams against each other on its most-watched day of regular-season football was accidental, you also believe the 2020 U.S. election was stolen. Pitch in another game on Friday and the NFL is bilking every dollar that it can from the Thanksgiving season. It's the NFL. I'd expect nothing less. Trump and the NFL; relentlessly rapacious. 
<br></br>
You've heard it from everyone and I concur; the Rams are the best team in football and I don't even think it's close. I'm not sure they'll lose again. Take away a blocked field goal against the Eagles and an overtime fumble against the 49ers and they're 11-0. 15-2 is possible as the Rams will be favoured in each of its remaining games. If you think that’s an overreaction to what they did to the Buccaneers, I urge you to revisit the five games that preceded Sunday night’s beatdown. The Rams have now won six in a row, and five of those wins were over teams that would make the playoffs if the season ended today. The lopsided win also gave the Rams the league’s best point differential, at plus-127—and the NFC’s best record.  If this isn’t the best team in football, which team is?  They can beat you through the air on the ground or with their defence. Stafford is the league's MVP and has ungodly numbers throwing to Nacua and Adams. But try to limit their passing game and Kyren Williams will gash you on the ground. Even If you slow LA's offence, you're still in for a fight. They lead the league in fewest points allowed and have forced 20 turnovers, the second-most in the league. Really, short of season-ending injury to one of their four offensive stars, who's going to beat them in the NFC?
<br></br>
Philly? Not a chance. The biggest advantage they had over the Rams was playing in Philadelphia in January. That's out the window. Their defence can't always bail the flailing offence out as demonstrated on Sunday when they squandered a 21 point lead to Dallas. Have you ever heard of a Super Bowl champion leading the league in three and out the following year? 
Detroit? Talk about your Jekyll and Hyde. They're kingslayers one week and kicking 60 yard field-goals to force overtime against the Giants the next. Goff has thrown for a 1000 fewer yards than he did last year at this point. And when they're in tight games against equally strong teams, Campbell's all-in all-the-time mentality will sink them, as his 0-5 performance against Philly a couple weeks past showed us. 
Green Bay? Is there, or has there ever been, a more boring team than the Green Bay Packers? There's conservative football and then there's Green Bay. Run, run, pass. Every bloody series. Last week they ran the ball on first down every single time against Minnesota. When 14 points will win you the game maybe that's the way to go, but they play that way every week. They have no confidence in Jordan Love and that's warranted. Earth to Matt LaFleur: Worry less about your hair and more about your play-calling. Having a stellar regular-season record is for losers. The ultra-conservative plays the profligate on the first game Thursday.
SF? Doesn't warrant a response. Tampa Bay? That question has already been answered. Chicago? A flat-out fraud. They're 8-3 and have given up more points than they've scored. I don't think they'll even make the playoffs. 
The only team that can prevent the Rams from going to the Super Bowl is Seattle. They know it and the Rams know it and they know that the Rams know it. That's a good headspace. Machiavallian 101. Darnold was picked four times the first time out and they lost by 2 with a chance to win on a last-second field goal. Seattle at LA Rams would be a great conference final.
<br></br>
We'll talk about the AFC next week.
<br></br>
After Daniel Jones' second-half collapse against the Chiefs and the Sam Darnold melt down against the Rams two weeks ago their narrative is the same: they can beat bad teams, but fold under pressure against good teams. Say what you like, they've steered their teams to 8-3 records and will be in the playoffs. They were also the property of the Minnesota Vikings until the braintrust of the purple and gold decided they liked the possibility of door number three; the oft-injured JJ McCarthy they'd spent first-round capital to acquire in the 2024 draft. I guess 13-4 in their first year with Darnold wasn't good enough. So they let Darnold and Jones, who they claimed after he was released from the Giants, walk and are now saddled with a quarterback who has consistently demonstrated he doesn't have it and yet are tied to because of his baseless first-round status they tapped him with. The Vikings went all in during the offseason and spent more money in free agency than all but one team, only to hand the keys to the roster to an unproven, young passer with severe mechanical flaws who was coming off a knee injury. If he would have had a pre-season quarterback competition against Darnold last year, they would have known. But that never happened. Darnold went to Seattle and is thriving while the Vikings are left to contemplate their future at quarterback.  And don't let O'Connell's semantics about his fundamentals and arm strength and elongated eye black being spot-on deceive you. That's poppycock. Those are the words you use when he sees what everyone else sees, but knows are hollow and meaningless and can't disguise the mess they have become.  Nothing against JJ McCarthy because second to the Patriots I am a Vikings fan and I want him to succeed, but the eye test tells me he isn't good enough. Game in, game out, against NFL, not college competition, he can't produce, and the NFL is a production league. This is a pass-friendly offence filled with good players. There's too much offensive talent to be sidelined because the quarterback who can't get it done. With McCarthy again in concussion protocol, undrafted Max Brosmer is next in line. Do you throw him out there when you know he'll be worse than Wentz at his worst? He could be the raw meat thrown to the Seattle defence this weekend. 
<br></br>
A whopping 10 of the 16 games this week are dbs. You want to make up some ground on the leaders? Here's your chance.
