Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
For the first time in its more than 10+ years of services to members of the Pick’em League, temporary incapacity renders me unable to perform a weekly report. Granted, I’ve taken byes, weeks off, and any number of weeks where the editorial standard was so critically compromised that it was red-lining, barely recognizable and largely incoherent, but this the first time in its history that the Commissioner has entered the Injured Reserve. Full recovery is expected, but a return date is uncertain. Everything continues as is minus the D- editorial on the front page of the site.

Hardly seems like the time to be shrilling for annual dues, but timing, like my writing, has never been my strong suit. I don’t know if I have any strong suits. I have good hair. Anyway, our online payment system, Stripe, is up and operational and accepting all currencies. A number of you have anted up, but most haven’t.

Switching sports, we have nation of Jays fans in Canada right now, whether you live in Toronto or not. We’re getting beaten up economically these days, facing inner turmoil and external threats. But we’re a country of tough people, who won’t back down from a fight, and often find national pride in our sports. I’d be remiss if I didn’t urge Toronto to finish the job, and bring the World Series title back to Canada. Batter up! Elbows up! True North!
<br></br>
Regards,
<br></br>
<strong> John Wyndels<br>
Commissioner, NFL Pick'em</strong>
