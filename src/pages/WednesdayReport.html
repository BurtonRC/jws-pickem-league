Welcome to the Wednesday Report, a biased, highly opinionated compendium of thoughts and insights on the NFL.
<br></br>
 I am temporarily suspending operations of the Wednesday Report. I have to concentrate my efforts on getting stronger and healthier while operating in a straight leg brace. For those of you not in the know, I am a paraplegic; an active paraplegic, but a paraplegic nonetheless. I can't use my legs for walking, running, swimming, skipping , fucking or anything an able-bodied person would use their legs to do or assist in doing. A complete lesion of my spinal cord made sure of that. But my legs play a central role in balance and transferring my body from my wheelchair to chairs, beds, cars etc. Just as you can't do all the things you count on your legs for doing when broken, I similarly do mine. That's where the similarity ends. My recovery is considerably more complicated in every way, shape and form. That is the source of my injured status, which has upended my life and blown a hole in the Wednesday Report.   
<br></br>
The titanium sports wheelchair I regularly use has been replaced by a rented wheelchair with a leg support sticking straight out in front of me from my sitting position. Whereas my wheelchair is compact, light and nimble, this rented monstrosity is a tank, longer in length than some adults are in height. My leg has been in a brace for close to three weeks and I have another three weeks of pure unadulterated hell ahead of me before I can regain a modicum of normalcy because let me assure you, things are not normal. If my house was anything less than a modern, uncluttered, hardwood pad of wide entries and sliding doors, I'd still be in the hospital, inhabiting a perdition I've seldom let myself sink to. I say all this not as a missive seeking sympathy, but a genuine apology for failing to carry out my responsibilities as the Commissioner. As much as I may sometimes complain of the weekly compilation of facts, fallacy and complete fabrications manufactured to cobble something together, I genuinely enjoy it. And If I can bring together dozens of football fans together from Dublin to Vancouver to Charlotte, North Carolina on a four month parlay of betting and braggadocio, count me in. 
<br></br>
So bear with the Pick'em league. Bear with the not completely bug-free, yet largely nascent league site that is administered tirelessly by the indefatigable Roudy. Bear with me as the injured and often misguided Commissioner, and frown as the New England Patriots once again reign supreme as Super Bowl champions.
